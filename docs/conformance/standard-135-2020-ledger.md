## Annex J BACnet/IP

| Row ID | Anchor | Priority | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BACNET-J-BVLC-FUNCTION-CODES` | Annex J.2 | P0 | `implementation-present-needs-conformance-tests` | J-01 covers Annex J.2 constants through `0x0B`, representative frames, malformed type/length, unknown function passthrough, deleted-value passthrough, and current decoder policy for extra bytes beyond BVLC Length. J-02 adds exact two-byte BVLC-Result parsing, unknown result-code passthrough, malformed result rejection, and sender/expected-function correlation for pending management responses. |
| `BACNET-J-ORIGINAL-UNICAST-NPDU` | Annex J | P0 | `implementation-present-needs-negative-tests` | J-04 Original-NPDU evidence covers UDP sender B/IP MAC delivery and self-originated frame suppression; directed reply-path integration remains open. |
| `BACNET-J-ORIGINAL-BROADCAST-NPDU` | Annex J | P0 | `implementation-present-needs-negative-tests` | J-04 Original-NPDU evidence covers BBMD Original-Broadcast local delivery, BDT/FDT Forwarded-NPDU fanout with original sender preservation, and no local Forwarded-NPDU echo. Remote/global NPDU broadcast addressing remains open. |
| `BACNET-J-FORWARDED-NPDU` | Annex J | P0 | `implementation-present-needs-negative-tests` | J-04 covers originating-address parsing, truncated-address rejection, BBMD delivery with originating B/IP source MAC, FDT fanout preserving the origin, local rebroadcast for unicast peer arrivals, directed-broadcast peer local-rebroadcast suppression, no onward forwarding to other BDT peers, and Original-Broadcast BDT/FDT Forwarded-NPDU emission. Non-BDT Forwarded-NPDU evidence verifies rejection before local delivery, local rebroadcast, BDT fanout, or FDT fanout. DBTN evidence covers registered foreign-device fanout to local broadcast, BDT peer, and non-origin FDT peer while preserving the origin, excluding origin echo, checking for no extra duplicate frames, and returning `X'0060'` when deterministic local Forwarded-NPDU forwarding fails. |
| `BACNET-J-BBMD-BDT` | Annex J.4/J.5 | P0 | `implementation-present-needs-conformance-tests` | J-03 covers read/write BDT caller paths, replacement semantics, malformed Write-BDT NAK without table mutation, self-entry insertion without overflow, and directed-broadcast forwarding target calculation. J-04 adds Forwarded-NPDU BDT mask behavior, no onward forwarding to other BDT peers, non-BDT sender rejection before BDT fanout, and Original-Broadcast one-peer fanout without local echo. DBTN fanout covers a registered foreign-device request forwarded to a BDT peer plus local broadcast and FDT targets without extra duplicate frames. J-07 adds project ACL evidence for the legacy Write-BDT path: listed management senders can update the table, and unlisted senders receive the standard Write-BDT NAK without table mutation. BDT persistence remains open. |
| `BACNET-J-FOREIGN-DEVICE-FDT` | Annex J.5 | P0 | `implementation-present-needs-conformance-tests` | J-03 covers FDT read/register/delete caller paths, re-registration, zero-TTL and malformed TTL NAKs, exact Delete-FDT payload length, max TTL remaining-time capping, expiry purge, source exclusion, and unregistered DBTN NAK without local delivery. J-04 Original-Broadcast evidence covers one registered FDT target; DBTN evidence covers registered origin plus peer FDT fanout, source preservation, no echo to the originating foreign device, no extra duplicate FDT frames, and `X'0060'` when forwarding cannot be completed. Non-BDT Forwarded-NPDU evidence verifies no FDT fanout. J-06 adds a BBMD-owned timer purge task for Annex J.5.2.3, covers expiration without an inbound BVLC request, and covers re-registration resetting the entry before the purge task removes it. J-07 adds project ACL evidence for Delete-FDT: listed management senders can delete registered entries, and unlisted senders receive the standard Delete-FDT NAK without removing the entry. |
| `BACNET-J-NAT-TRAVERSAL` | Annex J.7.5 | P0 | `deferred-pending-owner-decision` | Current IPv4 B/IP surfaces expose interface, port, broadcast address, BDT/FDT management, and foreign-device registration, but no reviewed global B/IP address field, NAT mode flag, BBMD/router logical-port model, or NAT-specific originating-address rewrite. Follow-up work item `019f0ff8-14c0-7013-9721-3bc5fe0356de` tracks the owner decision and implementation plan if support is later claimed. |
| `BACNET-J-IP-MULTICAST` | Annex J.8 | P0 | `deferred-pending-owner-decision` | Current IPv4 B/IP transport sends local broadcasts to a configured IPv4 broadcast address and has no B/IP-M multicast group membership, multicast send, or B/IP-M BBMD group configuration. BACnet/IPv6 multicast evidence belongs to Annex U, not Annex J. Follow-up work item `019f0ff8-14e7-7681-8738-032683da62df` tracks the owner decision and implementation plan if support is later claimed. |

## Annex K BIBBs

## Annex L Profiles

| Row ID | Anchor | Priority | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BACNET-L-PROFILES` | Annex L | P2 | `in-progress` | Profile evidence must be derived from ledger/PICS rows later. |

| `BACNET-AB-SC-HUB-CONNECTOR` | Annex AB.5 | P0 | `implementation-present-needs-conformance-tests` | SC transport and hub paths exist. |
| `BACNET-AB-SC-WEBSOCKET-TLS` | Annex AB.7 | P0 | `implementation-present-needs-security-tests` | WebSocket/TLS paths exist; mTLS/security tests remain open. |
| `BACNET-AB-SC-HEARTBEAT` | Annex AB.6.3 | P0 | `implementation-present-needs-timeout-tests` | SC heartbeat code exists; deterministic timeout tests remain open. |

## Explicit Deferred Or Unsupported Annexes

| Row ID | Anchor | Priority | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BACNET-O-ZIGBEE` | Annex O | P3 | `unknown-pending-source-review` | No public support claim found in the initial scan. |

## Follow-Up Backlog

Rows not marked `supported-with-clause-evidence` are follow-up work. The next Annex J tranche should continue BBMD/BDT/FDT lifecycle evidence, including BDT persistence, platform broadcast behavior, and forwarding loop prevention. NAT traversal and B/IP-M multicast are now explicitly tracked as deferred owner-decision rows.
