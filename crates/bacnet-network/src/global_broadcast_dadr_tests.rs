//! An inbound NPDU whose DNET is 0xFFFF and that also carries a DADR
//! (#1379), on the wire.
//!
//! DNET 0xFFFF already names every device on every network (Clauses 6.2.2
//! and 6.3.2), so a DADR beside it contradicts it. Hand-built NPDU bytes go
//! in through loopback peers, as an APDU and as a network message, with DADRs
//! of 1, 6 and 18 octets. The non-router [`NetworkLayer`] hands neither to
//! its receivers, and the router forwards, delivers, answers and rejects
//! nothing. Each counts every such NPDU in `global_broadcast_dadr_drops`.
//! Frames sent right after the refused ones are the first to come out, which
//! shows the refused ones went nowhere, and a global broadcast with DLEN 0
//! still goes everywhere it should.
