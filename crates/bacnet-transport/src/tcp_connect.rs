//! TCP dial that races a host's addresses, RFC 8305 ("Happy Eyeballs") style.
//!
//! A host name can resolve to several addresses, and the first may not answer:
//! `localhost` resolves to `::1` first on Windows, and a refused loopback
//! connect takes about two seconds there, so an IPv4-only peer cost every dial
//! that long when the addresses were tried one after another (#950). Here the
//! families alternate, and each attempt gets a head start of
//! [`CONNECTION_ATTEMPT_DELAY`] before the next one begins.
