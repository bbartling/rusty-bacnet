//! BBMD set-up in `start()`: the starting BDT and this BBMD's own B/IP
//! address (#937).
//!
//! The own address is the originating address of the BBMD's own forwarded
//! broadcasts, the BDT row it never forwards to, and the source its receive
//! loop drops as its own echo. Bound to one interface, it is that interface's
//! address and the bound port. Bound to `0.0.0.0`, the transport cannot tell
//! which local address its peers know it by, so it reads it from the BDT it
//! runs with:
//!
//! - the one BDT row whose IP is a local IPv4 address and whose port is the
//!   bound port;
//! - with several such rows, `start()` fails and asks for an explicit
//!   interface;
//! - with none, the address the host uses toward its default route, but only
//!   when that is a local, non-loopback address; otherwise `start()` fails.
//!
//! The local IPv4 addresses are the ones `local_addresses` lists, on every OS;
//! when they cannot be listed or none is usable, a wildcard `start()` fails
//! before it gets here.
//!
//! The BDT is the persisted one when it loads, else the configured one. A
//! persisted BDT that loads is authoritative: when no own address can be
//! chosen from it, `start()` fails rather than retrying with the configured
//! BDT. Only a self row that would overflow the persisted BDT still falls back
//! to the configured BDT, with a warning.
//!
//! Every start of a wildcard-bound BBMD repeats the choice, so a restart
//! follows address changes.
