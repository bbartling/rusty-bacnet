//! The sockets a B/IP transport binds at start (#892, #950, #1538), and one
//! destruction order for a socket and the registered-object lease.
//!
//! A transport binds one of two ways:
//!
//! - **Wildcard** (the default): one socket on `0.0.0.0:port`. It receives
//!   unicast and broadcasts alike, in the order they arrive, and the receive
//!   loop takes unicast only to the interface address. A port the OS picks is
//!   never shared (#892); an explicitly requested one sets `SO_REUSEADDR`.
//! - **Per address**, opted into with
//!   [`set_share_port_by_address`](super::BipTransport::set_share_port_by_address)
//!   and needing an explicit interface and a nonzero port: the socket binds
//!   `interface:port`, so transports on different addresses of one host can
//!   share one port, each getting only its own unicast (#1538). Every send
//!   leaves from that socket, so its source is the interface address. The
//!   configured broadcast address must be the interface's subnet broadcast
//!   or 255.255.255.255 (or the interface itself, as loopback tests set it),
//!   judged by the netmask the host reports. How broadcasts arrive differs by
//!   OS:
//!   - Linux delivers a broadcast only to sockets bound to the wildcard
//!     address or to the broadcast address itself. Receive-only listeners
//!     bind the configured broadcast address and 255.255.255.255 with
//!     `SO_REUSEADDR`, which several transports on one subnet share, and Linux
//!     hands a broadcast to each. No listener can see a unicast, and the
//!     address socket needs no `SO_REUSEADDR`, so no other socket can bind the
//!     same address and port, or the wildcard address on it.
//!   - macOS and the BSDs refuse to bind 255.255.255.255, so one receive-only
//!     listener binds `0.0.0.0:port` with `SO_REUSEADDR` and `SO_REUSEPORT`,
//!     which several such listeners need, and each gets a broadcast. A unicast
//!     to a local address that no socket on the port is bound to can reach a
//!     listener, which drops it. The address socket sets `SO_REUSEADDR` to
//!     bind beside the listeners; another socket binding the same address and
//!     port would also need `SO_REUSEPORT` on both, so it is refused.
//!   - Windows delivers a broadcast arriving on the interface to a socket bound
//!     to the interface address, so that one socket is enough. Its
//!     `SO_REUSEADDR` would let another socket bind the same address and take
//!     the unicast sent there, so it claims the address with
//!     `SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE` instead, as `port_ownership` does for a private
//!     port (#950). Other addresses can still share the port, and so can a
//!     socket already bound to the wildcard address without
//!     `SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE`.
//!
//!   The receive loop reads the address socket and the listeners fairly, in
//!   no fixed order, so a broadcast and a unicast that arrive together may be
//!   handled in either order; a unicast that depends on a broadcast sent just
//!   before it can be handled first. A listener on 255.255.255.255 or
//!   `0.0.0.0` hears every interface, so it keeps only what arrived on the
//!   transport's own (the index from `IP_PKTINFO` on Linux, `IP_RECVIF` on
//!   macOS and the BSDs). A listener that fails is closed, and unicast goes
//!   on.
