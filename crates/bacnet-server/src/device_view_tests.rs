//! The full-server Device view answers every read-only `BACnetObject` query
//! with the wrapped object's own answer, and keeps answers of its own only
//! where a Device's executor-owned properties need them (#1076).
//!
//! The rows and the probe are shared with SourceReporter's tests in
//! bacnet-endpoint (#1097). The trait's methods are read from its source, so
//! a query added there fails `every_read_query_has_a_forwarding_check` until
//! it has a row, and `the_view_forwards_every_read_query` until the view
//! forwards it.
