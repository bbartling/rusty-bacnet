//! Untimestamped COV-multiple references whose values a report began going
//! out without (#1038).
//!
//! Untimestamped values have no queue: each report reads them afresh, so the
//! newest value always wins. What a reference needs once a report that split
//! its values leaves it undelivered is a later report, and the mark kept here
//! gets it one: the deadline backstop hands an owed reference out like a
//! pending timestamped change of its context, measured from when it was first
//! owed, and a hold-off or re-enabled communication moves that attempt the
//! same way. The report that next evaluates the reference takes the mark,
//! whether or not the reference still has anything to report, and owes it
//! again only if that report does not deliver it either.
