//! Retained timestamped COV-multiple changes (135-2020 §13.16.3.1.2.3, §13.17.1.1).
//!
//! A reference subscribed with `Timestamped=TRUE` must report every qualifying
//! change with the local time it happened, and keep those changes until a
//! notification carrying them is sent. Producers capture each change under
//! the database write guard; the notification builder drains the queue into a
//! [`TimedClaim`] that requeues its entries unless the notification was
//! delivered: transmitted when unconfirmed, acknowledged when confirmed. Keeping
//! a confirmed report's changes until its Ack is local policy (#896).
//!
//! Changes are normally reported as soon as they are captured. A change stays
//! queued when its notification fails or is held back: a failed send, an
//! unanswered confirmed report, DISABLE_INITIATION, an exhausted budget. The
//! context's Max_Notification_Delay, an upper bound, then limits the wait,
//! measured from its earliest queued change (§13.1, §13.16.1.1.4):
//! [`TimedStore::next_due`] hands the server each context whose deadline has
//! passed, and the server fans it out again.
//!
//! Local policy for that backstop:
//! - it acts no sooner than one second after the earliest change;
//! - after an attempt it waits the delay (one second at least) before the
//!   next one, so a persistent failure cannot spin;
//! - a confirmed hold-off moves the next attempt to the end of the hold-off,
//!   and an outstanding confirmed report leaves the follow-up to its outcome;
//! - [`TimedStore::rearm`] drops every wait when a block lifts
//!   (communication re-enabled, a shorter delay admitted), so overdue changes
//!   go out at once.
//!
//! Untimestamped references have no queue: their current values are read
//! again for each report. One whose values a report began going out without
//! (parts held back after an earlier part went, or deferred behind a
//! confirmed report's outstanding part) is owed instead, and the backstop
//! treats it as a pending change of its context, from the moment it was
//! first owed (#1038). The report that next evaluates it takes the mark.
//!
//! Delays and waits live only with timestamped histories and owed
//! references, so a context with neither costs nothing here.
//!
//! Changes that one notification cannot carry go out in several (§13.1,
//! §13.18.1.1), strictly in capture order: [`TimedClaim::split_oldest`] moves
//! the oldest changes, a reference's latest included, into earlier
//! notifications (#1008). A change too large for a notification even alone
//! goes out one value per notification instead, in its captured order
//! ([`TimedClaim::split_values`]); only the part with its last value delivers
//! the change, and parts that come back undelivered rejoin as one change
//! (#1090). An unconfirmed context sends one such report at a time
//! ([`SendTurn`]), so a later report cannot overtake the parts of an earlier
//! one. Untimestamped values that one notification cannot carry go out after
//! every timestamped change, split by object item (#1038).
//!
//! Local bound policy: the pending changes of one COV-multiple context are
//! limited to an estimate of what [`HISTORY_NOTIFICATIONS`] notifications can
//! carry, each sized to the lesser of the local and the subscriber's maximum
//! APDU, less the envelope the encoder puts around a notification's items for
//! that context ([`envelope_len`], #1197). The envelope is sized from the
//! context itself: its confirmed or unconfirmed header, its process
//! identifier, and the lifetime it had left when last admitted, which later
//! notifications report as less, never in more octets. This room for items
//! counts each change's values and item framing, as if every change started
//! its own item. It keeps a reserve, per context and at most one
//! notification's worth, for the room the context's untimestamped values took
//! in its reports since it was last admitted or lost a reference; they travel
//! with the last notification.
//!
//! Memory has a ceiling of its own (#1287), counted in the bytes a pending
//! change really takes (#1357): [`CHANGE_MEMORY`] for the change itself, in
//! its slot of the history's queue, and for each of its values
//! [`VALUE_MEMORY`], the value's slots in the change's vectors, plus its
//! encoded octets on the heap. A context's changes take no more than
//! [`CEILING_BYTES_PER_OCTET`] bytes for each octet [`HISTORY_NOTIFICATIONS`]
//! notifications of the local maximum APDU have for items, whatever its
//! subscriber's size, so many tiny changes cannot outgrow it: 23,216 bytes at
//! a 1476-octet local maximum, about 116 of the smallest changes (one empty
//! value each) or 87 REAL Present_Value and Status_Flags changes. A change
//! takes four to twelve times the bytes in memory that it takes octets in a
//! notification; four bytes an octet keeps about the history #1287 kept when
//! it charged a fixed 32 octets per change, a quarter of what the smallest
//! change takes. Near the local maximum the ceiling binds before the room
//! does; a small subscriber's room binds first. The room counts only octets
//! that travel in a notification: charged with memory, it would let a
//! 50-octet subscriber keep one REAL Present_Value change where four
//! notifications carry four.
//!
//! No ceiling spans the table; the subscription caps bound it. Each
//! COV-multiple reference counts as one subscription, so under the default
//! global cap of 1,024 there are at most 1,024 contexts, and their pending
//! changes take at most 1,024 times the ceiling, about 24 MB at a 1476-octet
//! local maximum, besides the changes eviction may not take, two per
//! reference at most (below).
//!
//! Only on overflow of either limit, the last resort, is a change dropped:
//! the oldest of the same reference first, then the oldest in the context.
//! Two changes of a reference are never evicted:
//! - its newest, so the bound never hides the reference's current state;
//! - its change in delivery (#1163): one sent value by value of which a part
//!   was delivered, or went out as a confirmed report's first part with the
//!   rest deferred, kept until its last value is delivered.
//!
//! The second is for small subscribers. At a 50-octet maximum APDU the room
//! comes to 68 to 100 octets of items, by the envelope's size: two or three
//! Present_Value and Status_Flags changes of 33 octets, so a value held back
//! by a failed send or a deferral would be evicted after a few newer changes,
//! and the value-by-value delivery of #1090 might never finish. Counting the
//! bound in values instead would still need an octet limit, as nothing limits
//! a value's size when it is captured, and would change eviction for every
//! change of such a context; exempting only the change already partly sent
//! leaves every other eviction as it was. Each reference marks one change in
//! delivery, the one a part last went out ahead of, so what a context holds
//! stays bounded: after eviction, no more than its room and its ceiling allow
//! or, beyond them, only changes eviction may not take, two per reference at
//! most.
//!
//! Each discarded change is counted in
//! [`AtomicCovCounters::timed_changes_dropped`]; the log gets one warning per
//! context and cause until the context is admitted afresh (#1039), so a
//! subscriber too small for any timestamped value does not flood it.
