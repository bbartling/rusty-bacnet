//! The work adding and removing objects leaves for the server (#1341).
//!
//! `ObjectDatabase::add` and `remove` judge again the Pulse Converters whose
//! Input_Reference names the object, under the caller's guard, and queue
//! those whose Reliability changed. COV for them is the server's: a
//! CreateObject or DeleteObject takes the queue under its own guard and
//! adds the fanout to the request's, and an application's own `add` or
//! `remove` wakes the waker [`install_waker`] puts on the database, which
//! the server's Schedule task waits on to take the queue under the next
//! guard it gets ([`settle_committed`]). Lock order is the server's: the
//! database guard, then the COV table.
