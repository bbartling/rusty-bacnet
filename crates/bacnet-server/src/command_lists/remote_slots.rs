//! Room for the requests runs make in other devices: a Command's remote
//! actions, and a Channel's reads and writes of its remote members (#1343).
//!
//! The server's runs share two bounds, whichever run makes the request:
//!
//! - [`RUN_REQUESTS`] requests outstanding at once across the whole server.
//!   Every run is its own task, and one WriteGroup can start many Channel
//!   distributions at once, so a bound per run would let them take most of
//!   the device's 256 invoke IDs, which confirmed COV and event notifications
//!   (up to 255 in flight) and Audit deliveries (up to 64) lease from too.
//!   Thirty-two, an eighth of them, leaves those the rest, and a run that
//!   still finds no invoke ID free fails that write as before.
//! - [`PER_DEVICE`] request outstanding at once in each device. Before
//!   Channel members were written side by side a device met one request from
//!   a run at a time, and many small devices, MS/TP ones especially, serve
//!   one confirmed request at a time and answer more with an Abort or not at
//!   all. One at a time also lets a device that answers nothing be found
//!   silent by a single request before the others for it go out.
//!
//! A request takes its device's slot before one of the server's, so a request
//! queued behind a slow device holds none of the server's. Both queues are
//! first come, first served. Dropping a slot, or a request still waiting for
//! one, frees what it held.
