//! Runs taken from their objects and not yet handed to whatever makes them
//! (#1324).
//!
//! A run is taken under the guard that committed the Present_Value write
//! that queued it, but its owner (a task in the server's request set, or
//! [`run_unattached`](super::run_unattached)'s queue) takes it up only once
//! the writer's COV, event and Schedule passes are done. A future cancelled
//! in between, a `write_local` under a timeout for one, would drop the run
//! with nothing to end it and leave its object busy. [`TakenRuns`] holds the
//! runs across that stretch and ends any it still holds when dropped.
