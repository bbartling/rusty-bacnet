//! Passing a Channel object's Present_Value on to its members (Clause 12.53,
//! #1151, #1264).
//!
//! Each member's Execution_Delay is measured from the moment the
//! distribution starts, so the delays overlap rather than add up
//! (Clause 12.53.12), and each member is written as soon as its own time is
//! reached, whatever the members before it are doing (#1343). Members in this
//! device are written one at a time, in order of delay and list order among
//! equal delays, so their writes keep that order. A member in another device
//! is its own future, so a write there that waits for its answer holds back
//! no member here or in another device. Both kinds are polled together, so a
//! member's future is never left unpolled while another member's write waits
//! for the database. Requests in other devices wait their turn in the
//! server's queues (`remote_slots`): one at a time per device and a bounded
//! number across the server, so a member due while its device is answering
//! another request is written once that one ends.
//!
//! A device that answers none of a request's attempts, or none of the Who-Is
//! sent to find it when it had no binding (#1322), is taken to be offline for
//! the rest of the distribution: its members whose requests come up after
//! that, their turn in the queue included, fail at once as communication
//! failures, with nothing sent. A distribution so waits out one request's
//! retries per silent device.
//!
//! For a member in this device the runner looks up the datatype of the
//! property's current value, coerces the channel value to it (Table 12-63)
//! and writes the result through the host's local write path at the priority
//! the Present_Value write carried, or none if it carried none. A member
//! naming another Device goes out as a confirmed WriteProperty through
//! [`RunHost::write_remote`] (Clause 12.53.11 leaves the method open). Its
//! datatype is learned first (#1342): a ReadProperty of the member's property
//! in that device, sent when the distribution starts so it overlaps the
//! member's delay, and the value is coerced to the datatype of what it
//! returns, as for a member here. A primitive datatype learned is kept on the
//! Channel for later distributions until the member is replaced, or until a
//! write made with it is refused as a configuration fault (an invalid
//! datatype, say), so a property whose datatype can change is read again. No
//! read is sent when the coercion can't depend on the answer: for a NULL, a
//! lighting command, or a member that is a Lighting_Command. A read that gets
//! no answer finds the device silent, since every device executes
//! ReadProperty: the member fails as a communication failure with no write
//! sent. A read that is refused, or returns NULL, a constructed value or an
//! answer that doesn't fit, leaves the value as written, and the device
//! itself refuses a datatype its property doesn't take; nothing is kept, so
//! the next distribution reads again.
//!
//! A coercion failure means that member isn't written, and counts as a
//! configuration failure: the member's datatype doesn't fit the value. A
//! refused or unanswered write counts as a failure too (sorted in `target`),
//! with one exception: a NULL refused as an invalid datatype, by an Error or
//! a Reject, so one channel can relinquish its commandable members while its
//! other members ignore the NULL (Clause 12.53.7). One failure doesn't stop
//! the rest (Clause 12.53.5.8); once every member has been tried, the
//! Channel's Write_Status becomes SUCCESSFUL or FAILED and its Reliability
//! takes the kind of the first failure to finish (Clause 12.53.9).
