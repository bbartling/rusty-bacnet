//! Running Command lists and Channel distributions without a server, for
//! [`tick_schedules`](crate::schedule::tick_schedules) (#1178, #1151).
//!
//! Each write is made as the bare WriteProperty handler would make a request
//! carrying it, with the Command or Channel as the initiating object. There
//! is no network here, so a command or Channel member naming another device
//! fails unsent, which a Channel reports as PROCESS_ERROR. There is no
//! COV table, notification path or task set either, so nothing is reported
//! and the runs go on inside the caller's future: a run that writes another
//! Command's or Channel's Present_Value starts that run beside it, and the
//! call returns once every run has ended.
