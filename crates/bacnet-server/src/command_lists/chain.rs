//! Stopping Command and Channel runs that feed back into themselves.
//!
//! A run's write can start another object's run: a Command's list writing a
//! Channel's Present_Value, a Channel member that is a Command, and so on.
//! Those objects refuse a Present_Value write only while their own run is in
//! progress, so a loop whose writes are spaced out by delays (two Channels
//! naming each other, or a Channel and a Command) would otherwise go round
//! for ever, each object idle again by the time the other writes back.
//!
//! Each [`CommandRun`] carries the objects whose runs led to it. When a run's
//! write queues further runs, each one inherits that chain plus the writing
//! run's own object. A queued run whose object is already in its chain closes
//! a loop, and one with more than [`MAX_RUN_DEPTH`] runs above it is too long
//! a chain to follow: neither is started. Its object took the write, so the
//! run is ended at once as if none of its writes were made (In_Process back
//! to FALSE with every command unsuccessful, or Write_Status FAILED), and the
//! write that queued it counts as failed too, with OBJECT / BUSY, the answer
//! an object gives a Present_Value write while it is still busy.
