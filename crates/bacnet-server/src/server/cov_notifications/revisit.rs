//! Fan acknowledged or fenced references out again (#896).
//!
//! A confirmed report advances its baseline only on the Ack, and changes made
//! while it was outstanding were held back. The acknowledged subscription, or
//! every live reference of the acknowledged context, is evaluated again through
//! the usual fanout, so it reports whatever now differs from its baseline
//! (Status_Flags and queued timestamped changes included) and nothing when it
//! is unchanged. References whose outstanding report was fenced by a route
//! change or re-subscription come through here too.
