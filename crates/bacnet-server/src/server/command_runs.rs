//! Running the writes a Command or Channel object's Present_Value write
//! queues (Clauses 12.10 and 12.53, #1150, #1151).
//!
//! The write only queues the run: under the guard that commits it, the object
//! checks the value, marks itself busy and leaves a [`CommandRun`], which the
//! server takes there and owns from then on (`crate::command_lists`). Each
//! run then goes into the server's request task set as its own task, so
//! neither the request that wrote Present_Value nor `write_local` waits for
//! it, delays included, and `stop` cancels it with the other request work.
//!
//! The writes are made one at a time, each through the same [`LocalWriter`]
//! path as `write_local`: priorities, command-source tracking, audit, COV and
//! the post-write event pass all apply as for any other local write. A
//! command naming another device goes out as a confirmed WriteProperty
//! through [`RemoteWriter`] (#1180). No database guard is held across a
//! write's notifications, an outstanding remote write or a delay. The
//! object's generation guards every report back, so a run whose object was
//! replaced or reconfigured stops.
//!
//! A run let go of before it ends (cancelled by `stop()`, refused by a closed
//! task set, or unwound by a panic) ends where it stood at once when the
//! database is free: the commands it hadn't made read unsuccessful, and it
//! counts as successful only if every write was made and succeeded. Otherwise
//! it waits in the request task set, and `stop()` ends it once those tasks are
//! joined and the database is free (#1252); a panic ends it straight away.
