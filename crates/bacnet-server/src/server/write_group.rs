//! Executing an inbound WriteGroup request (Clause 15.11, #1151).
//!
//! A WriteGroup names a control group, a write priority and a change list of
//! channel numbers, each with a BACnetChannelValue and maybe a priority of its
//! own. The server writes each value to the Present_Value of every local
//! Channel whose Channel_Number is that channel and whose Control_Groups holds
//! the group, at the entry's priority when it has one and at the request's
//! otherwise. Membership is read Channel by Channel: Clause 12.53.15 makes a
//! Channel, not its device, the member of a group, so a Channel outside the
//! group is left alone even when another Channel here is in it. Group 0 means
//! no assignment and never reaches here: the codec refuses it.
//!
//! Each value goes through the same [`LocalWriter`] path as `write_local` and
//! a Command's writes, so the Channel's own checks hold (BUSY while it
//! distributes, the value and priority checks, Out_Of_Service), and the
//! distribution the write queues starts through the server's
//! [`CommandRunner`]: coercion, Write_Status, the run chain, delays
//! and COV all behave as for a WriteProperty. One refused write is logged at
//! debug and the rest still go (Clause 15.11.2). The service is unconfirmed:
//! nothing goes back, and a request the codec refuses is dropped.
//!
//! The plan is made under a read guard and each write takes the write guard
//! afterwards, so another write can change a Channel in between.
//! [`LocalWriter`] checks the Channel again under its write guard: one that
//! has left the group or taken another Channel_Number since the plan is
//! skipped, logged at debug, and Allow_Group_Delay_Inhibit is read there too.
//!
//! A channel number listed twice in one change list reaches the same
//! Channels twice, in list order. The later value is refused as BUSY while
//! the distribution the earlier one queued is still running and taken once
//! it has finished, so which value stays depends on timing.
//!
//! The Inhibit Delay flag zeroes the delays of a Channel's distribution only
//! when that Channel's Allow_Group_Delay_Inhibit is TRUE (Clause 12.53.13);
//! otherwise each member waits its Execution_Delay as usual.
//!
//! Local mutation policy decides each Channel write on its own, just before
//! it is made and with no database guard held (#1319):
//! [`MutationPolicy::DenyAll`] denies it, and an installed authorizer sees a
//! [`MutationTarget::WriteGroup`] naming the Channel, the entry and the
//! priority, with the requester's addresses and provenance, no invoke ID and
//! the unconfirmed service. A denied write is skipped with nothing sent back,
//! since the service is unconfirmed, and counted in the WriteGroup mutation
//! decision counters; the other Channels are decided on their own.
//!
//! Each write that goes ahead is audited as a WRITE, the operation Table 19-5
//! gives WriteGroup, of that Channel's Present_Value at the priority used:
//! one record per Channel written, as Clause 19.6.5 asks of a service with
//! several targets. The requester is the source (the Device bound to its
//! address, when the audit profile knows one), with no invoke ID, which an
//! unconfirmed request doesn't have (Table 19-4). A denied write makes no
//! record (#1318). Under DCC's DISABLE_INITIATION a WriteGroup still runs: it
//! initiates nothing.
