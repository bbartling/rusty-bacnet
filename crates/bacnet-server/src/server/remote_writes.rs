//! Writes this server makes in other devices on behalf of its own objects: a
//! Command action naming another Device (Clause 12.10.8, #1180), or a Channel
//! member in another device (Clause 12.53.11, #1264). A Channel also reads
//! such a member's property first, to learn the datatype it coerces its value
//! to (#1342); that ReadProperty takes the same path, asks for an unsegmented
//! answer and takes only that, and everything below about a write holds for
//! it too.
//!
//! Each write goes out as one unsegmented confirmed WriteProperty. The address
//! comes from the server's device bindings: a configured binding, or an I-Am
//! heard in the last ten minutes. A device with neither is looked for first
//! (#1322): one Who-Is limited to its instance, then a wait of the APDU
//! timeout, a minute at most, from the send, for its I-Am. The Who-Is goes to
//! every network for a device never heard from, or to the network the
//! device's stale observation names, which a Who-Is that draws nothing
//! drops. A write that misses while that Who-Is is out waits on it instead
//! of sending another, and a device gets at most one Who-Is a minute
//! (`binding_probes`), so a write that misses within a minute of a Who-Is
//! that drew nothing fails at once. A write that ends with no binding sends no WriteProperty. A binding
//! routed through the network numbered as this device's own, once that number
//! is known, names a device on this network: the write goes to its MAC with
//! no DNET, not through the router (#1358), since a non-routing device drops
//! an NPDU whose DNET names a network (Clause 6.5.2.1).
//!
//! The invoke ID is leased from the same device-wide pool as confirmed
//! notifications (and, in an endpoint, client requests), so no two
//! outstanding transactions share one, and the answer comes back through the
//! notifications' dispatch fast path. The lease carries the peer and the
//! WriteProperty service: only that peer's answer ends it, and a SimpleACK or
//! Error only when it names WriteProperty, so a late answer to a notification
//! that once held the same invoke ID can't complete the write.
//!
//! Each attempt waits `cov_retry_timeout_ms` for an answer, and only silence
//! earns another attempt, up to the server's three retries; an Error (BUSY
//! included), Reject or Abort is final, and the caller gets what it said
//! (#1323): the Error's class and code, or the Reject or Abort reason.
//! Nothing is sent while DeviceCommunicationControl restricts initiation, a
//! Who-Is included, since Clause 16.1 lets such a device start no request but
//! I-Am answers and audit notifications: a retry it would block, or one whose
//! observed binding has lapsed, ends the write there and frees its invoke ID.
//! The caller holds no database guard while a write is outstanding or waits
//! for an I-Am, and the binding table's guard is never held across a send or
//! a wait.
