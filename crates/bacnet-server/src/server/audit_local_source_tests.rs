//! A request that arrives from a Device bound through this device's own
//! network number is tied to that Device, as sends to it take the binding as
//! a local one (#1358, #1404). The node is on this network, so its request
//! comes straight from its MAC with no SNET, or through a router here that
//! adds this network's number and the node's MAC as SNET and SADR. Either
//! way the Audit record names the Device as its source and the command it
//! writes publishes the Device as its Value_Source. While the number is
//! unknown, for a binding routed to another network, or when two bindings
//! name the same MAC, both name the address the request came from.
//!
//! Device 30 writes from `SOURCE`; requests reach the server as NPDUs on its
//! link and its answers are read back from there. Device 20 is the Audit
//! recipient, bound at `LOGGER`.
