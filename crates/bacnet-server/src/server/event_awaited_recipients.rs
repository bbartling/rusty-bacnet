//! Event notifications to a Device recipient the server holds no fresh
//! binding for (#1368).
//!
//! Such a recipient used to be skipped, and counted in
//! `device_recipient_unbound`. Now the server looks for its device through
//! the binding table's probes ([`DeviceLookup`]), as a Command or Channel
//! write in another device does (#1322): one Who-Is limited to the device's
//! instance, at most one a minute per device, shared by everything that
//! misses while it is out, and none while DeviceCommunicationControl
//! restricts initiation.
//!
//! The notification waits for the I-Am, for the probe's bounded wait, the
//! APDU timeout from the Who-Is. A notification's recipients are served one
//! after another, so the wait is not made there. Each device being looked
//! for has a queue of the notifications waiting for it, in the order they
//! were made, and one task in the notification task set that waits on the
//! device's probe and then sends them, one at a time, along the same path as
//! every other recipient ([`BACnetServer::send_on_route`]). While a device's
//! queue holds anything, a new notification for it joins the queue rather
//! than going straight out, so a transition made just after the I-Am can't
//! overtake the ones before it. Each device drains on its own: one that
//! answered doesn't wait for another's probe. The notification's other
//! recipients, and the caller, never wait, and `stop()` aborts the tasks
//! with the other notification workers.
//!
//! The order kept is the order the server makes one device's notifications
//! in, one after another, a probe's wait included. Notifications made at
//! once from different tasks have no order between them, and a confirmed
//! notification's attempts run in a transaction task of its own, so the
//! first attempts of two confirmed ones may go out in either order.
//!
//! At most [`MAX_AWAITING_NOTIFICATIONS`] notifications wait at once, across
//! every device; one more is skipped and counted at once, with no Who-Is.
//!
//! The counters stay as they were for one destination: a recipient whose
//! device stays silent counts once in `device_recipient_unbound`, as does
//! one that can't be looked for (within the hold-off of a fruitless Who-Is,
//! or with too many devices or notifications waiting), and a notification
//! sent after the I-Am counts as any other send does. Nothing is counted for
//! one DCC holds back: DCC is checked again before each send.
