//! Deciding a WritePropertyMultiple's durable attempts ahead of its handler
//! (#1321).
//!
//! An attempt on an object that saves its state first is staged before the
//! handler runs, so its save can run with the database guard dropped
//! (`durable_writes`). Staging a save for an attempt policy then denies would
//! put a state in storage that no client was told about. So with an
//! authorizer installed, the request asks it about each such attempt first,
//! in wire order and after the checks the handler makes on that attempt,
//! and stages only those before the first it denies, since the request
//! stops there.
//!
//! The handler, reaching one of those attempts under the guard, takes the
//! decision made here instead of asking again. The authorizer is asked once
//! per attempt, and the decision counters count an attempt only when the
//! handler reaches its gate, as before. The price: an attempt decided here
//! that the request never reaches, because an earlier attempt failed, was
//! still put to the authorizer.
