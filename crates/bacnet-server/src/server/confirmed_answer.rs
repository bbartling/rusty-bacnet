//! The answer a device gives a confirmed request this server sent: a
//! confirmed notification, or a WriteProperty a run makes in another device.
//!
//! An answer that turns the request down keeps what it said (#1323): the
//! Error PDU's class and code, or the Reject or Abort reason. Notification
//! senders only ask whether the request was taken; a Channel writing a member
//! in another device needs the code too, since a NULL refused as an invalid
//! datatype still counts as written (Clause 12.53.7).
