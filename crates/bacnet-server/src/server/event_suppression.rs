//! Lifetime counters for event notifications the server did not deliver (#1142).
use super::*;
use bacnet_objects::notification_class::RecipientLookupOutcome;
use std::sync::atomic::AtomicU64;

/// Lifetime totals of event notifications that were not delivered, each
/// saturating at `u64::MAX`. A new server starts at zero, and the totals stay
/// readable after `stop()`. Fields are sampled independently, not as one
/// atomic aggregate. Each refusal also logs a warning (the forwarding cap's
/// at most once a minute); these totals are the
/// running signal, not an audit log.
///
/// The first four count transitions (event or acknowledgment notifications)
/// whose Notification Class lookup failed closed, so no recipient received
/// them. A class whose list is empty, or whose destinations all filter the
/// transition out by day, time or transition, is configured behaviour and is
/// not counted. Neither are notifications held back by DeviceCommunicationControl
/// or Event_Enable; DCC holds a confirmed one back at a retry too, ending it
/// there uncounted.
///
/// The next three count destinations that matched the transition but were
/// skipped while their route was resolved, once per destination: the rest of
/// the transition's destinations are still served. They are grouped by what
/// fixes them: a Device recipient the server holds no current address for,
/// a recipient that can never be routed as written, and a confirmed
/// recipient at a broadcast or other group address. The warning logged with
/// each skip names the finer reason.
///
/// The next three count confirmed notifications to one recipient that were
/// never acknowledged.
///
/// The next one counts unconfirmed notifications whose send failed at the
/// transport, once per destination. The transition's other destinations are
/// still served. There is no counter for a notification that fails to
/// encode: the committed payload and message text are validated before the
/// destinations are walked, so a well-formed transition always encodes, and
/// the send loop only logs and skips if that invariant is ever broken.
///
/// The next three concern the Notification Forwarder objects (#1225): copies
/// too large to send unsegmented, received notifications no forwarder took,
/// and destinations past the cap on one notification's copies (#1259).
///
/// The last one counts received notifications the Event Logs that collect
/// them would have taken but for their source's allowance (#1346).
