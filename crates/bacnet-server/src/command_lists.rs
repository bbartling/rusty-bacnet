//! Making the writes a Command or Channel object's Present_Value write
//! queues: a Command's action list (Clause 12.10) or a Channel's value for
//! each of its members (Clause 12.53, in `channel`).
//!
//! A Present_Value write that selects a list with commands sets In_Process,
//! and one that a Channel distributes sets Write_Status IN_PROGRESS; either
//! leaves a [`CommandRun`] on the object (#1150, #1151). Whatever commits that
//! write takes the run under the same guard and owns it from then on: it has
//! to finish the run, or the object stays busy and every later Present_Value
//! write is refused BUSY (#1178). The run is taken into a [`TakenRuns`], which
//! ends it if dropped before it reaches its owner (#1324), so a writer's
//! future cancelled between its commit and that hand-over leaves nothing busy.
//! Each owner finishes it in the way it can:
//!
//! - the bundled server runs it as a task beside the request that wrote it
//!   (`server::command_runs`);
//! - [`tick_schedules`](crate::schedule::tick_schedules) runs the runs its
//!   writes start before it returns ([`run_unattached`]);
//! - the synchronous WriteProperty and WritePropertyMultiple handlers have no
//!   task to wait out a delay in, so they end the run at once as unsuccessful
//!   ([`end_unmade`]).
//!
//! A server that stops ends what is left once its own work has stopped: runs
//! let go of while the database was busy, then any run nothing owns
//! ([`end_unowned`], #1252).
//!
//! [`execute`] is the sequence every runner shares. A Command's commands go
//! in list order, each through the owner's write path (a command naming
//! another device through [`RunHost::write_remote`]), each outcome recorded
//! under a generation check, the post delay after each attempt, a stop at a
//! failure that quits, then the end of the run. A Channel's members each go
//! once their own delay is up, through the same write paths, a member in
//! another device through [`RunHost::write_remote`] too, after a
//! [`RunHost::read_remote`] that learns its datatype (`channel`). A failed
//! write is sorted into a [`WriteFailure`] (`target`), and the run ends with
//! its first one, which a Channel reports in Reliability. A run a write starts
//! is admitted through `chain`, which stops runs that feed back into
//! themselves.
