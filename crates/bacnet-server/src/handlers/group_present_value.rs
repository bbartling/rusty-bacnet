//! A Group object's Present_Value, rebuilt from its members on every read
//! (Clause 12.14.6).
//!
//! A Group stores no Present_Value: the object can't reach its members, so
//! the read services build the list here, under the database guard the
//! request already holds.
//!
//! Work policy (#1172): a Group may list any number of members, and the
//! request that reads its Present_Value pays for them. Each member row, after
//! ALL, REQUIRED and OPTIONAL expand, counts against the same work limit as
//! the request's own rows (`ReadPropertyMultipleBudget::max_result_elements`).
//! Several Groups in one ReadPropertyMultiple share that one limit, and a
//! request that would pass it is aborted with OUT_OF_RESOURCES before any
//! member is read, the answer ReadPropertyMultiple gives any request over its
//! work limit. ReadProperty and ReadRange have no work limit of their own, so
//! they get the limit of a ReadPropertyMultiple that names only this
//! Present_Value: the row itself plus the member rows. On the shared
//! endpoint, which has no ReadPropertyMultiple budget, ReadProperty uses the
//! session's configured read work limit (#1215). The low-level helpers with
//! no executor view have no limit.
//!
//! A member may name the Device's COV subscription lists. Every read service
//! plans its rows, a Group's member rows included, before it reads a value,
//! and samples the live lists once for the request when the plan reads one,
//! so those member rows serve the request's one live snapshot (#1171, #1213).
