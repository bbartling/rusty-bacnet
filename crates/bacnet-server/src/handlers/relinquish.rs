//! A NULL written to a property that isn't commandable and whose datatype
//! has no NULL in it (Clauses 15.9.2, 15.10.2 and 19.2.1).
//!
//! The standard treats such a write as a relinquish there is nothing to
//! relinquish from: if the request is otherwise sound, the property keeps
//! its value and the write counts as a success. WriteProperty,
//! WritePropertyMultiple, the server's local write path (`write_local`,
//! `write_local_encoded` and a Command's writes), CreateObject's initial
//! values and a Schedule's writes to its targets settle it here, for every
//! object, rather than each object deciding for itself. Clause 19.2.1 holds
//! local actions to the same prioritization rules as service requests, so
//! the local paths follow the services.
//!
//! The write still goes to the object first, so every check the object
//! makes before it looks at the value keeps its answer: an unknown property,
//! a property that isn't writable or isn't writable in the object's state,
//! an array index out of range or an array whose size is fixed. Only a
//! refusal of the NULL as a value of the wrong datatype, PROPERTY /
//! INVALID_DATA_TYPE, becomes a success, and then only when
//!
//! - the property isn't commandable on this object (where a NULL takes a
//!   command out of the Priority_Array), and
//! - no member of its datatype is an application NULL ([`null_in_datatype`]).
//!
//! A property the object takes a NULL for never reaches this rule: a
//! commandable Present_Value relinquishing, a Schedule_Default storing NULL.
//! A reference property is no exception: an unset one reads, and is cleared
//! by writing, a reference to the reserved instance 4194303 (#1417), so a
//! NULL there comes here like on any other property.
//!
//! The value counts as a NULL when its whole encoding is one application
//! NULL. That covers a raw-octet property such as Recipient_List or an
//! Access Rights rule array, which reaches the object as those octets, and a
//! BACnetLIST written whole, which reaches it as a list of one NULL.
//!
//! An array element written with a NULL is judged the same way, against the
//! element's datatype, once the object has checked the index; index 0, the
//! array's size, is an Unsigned.
//!
//! Nothing changed, so nothing follows the write as a change: no COV report,
//! event pass, Schedule re-evaluation, Command run or save. An Audit
//! Reporter records it as the successful write the requester was told it is
//! (Clause 19.6.1). A CreateObject goes on to its next initial value, and a
//! Schedule counts the target as one that took its write.
