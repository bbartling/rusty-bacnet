//! Schedule execution engine.
//!
//! Periodically evaluates Schedule objects (Clause 12.24.4) against one Device
//! clock frame and writes the effective value to every controlled
//! object-property reference at the Schedule's Priority_For_Writing. A write
//! that commits to a Schedule runs the same evaluation for that Schedule at
//! once, since a change to what it holds can change its value (#1057).
//!
//! Each pass first sends what a Schedule owes apart from its calculation,
//! through the same target writes: the NULLs that relinquish slots a change
//! of its references or priority left behind (#1088), then a Present_Value a
//! client wrote while it was out of service (Clause 12.24.14, #1055). Those
//! need no clock. Then it calculates; that needs the clock, and a Schedule
//! out of service skips it.
//!
//! After each write the pass tells the Schedule how every target took it, so
//! a target that refuses the schedule's datatype faults it (Clause 12.24.13,
//! #1086), as does a reference naming a missing object or property or an
//! array index the property can't take (#1433). While such a refusal stands,
//! a pass with nothing else to send for that Schedule offers its value again
//! to the refused references alone (#1436): the 60-second tick, or the pass a
//! committed write to the Schedule runs, of any property. So the fault clears
//! within one tick of its cause going away: the array grown, say. A missing
//! object doesn't wait for the tick: once it is created, by CreateObject or
//! the application's own `ObjectDatabase::add`, the server retries the
//! references naming it at once (`retry_for_created`, #1440) and fans COV
//! out for what that writes. A retry still refused logs at debug, since it
//! repeats every pass; one that fails otherwise ends the refusal and warns
//! once.
//!
//! A NULL relinquishes the Schedule's slot in a commandable target. On a
//! target property that isn't commandable and has no NULL in its datatype,
//! it is the no-op WriteProperty would make of it (`handlers::relinquish`,
//! #1416): the property keeps its value and the target counts as having
//! taken the write. Every target here is local; a Schedule's references
//! name objects of its own device only.
