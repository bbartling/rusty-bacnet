//! The application's purge of an Audit Log on a running server (#1238).
use super::super::*;

#[pymethods]
impl BACnetServer {
    /// Purge an Audit Log: clear its records and append a BUFFER_PURGED
    /// status record.
    ///
    /// No peer can purge an Audit Log, since its Record_Count is read-only,
    /// so this is the application's route. The record is appended whether
    /// or not logging is enabled, and also carries LOG_DISABLED while
    /// logging is off; Total_Record_Count keeps counting.
    /// The log commits the purge to its storage before serving it, with the
    /// server's object database free meanwhile. Raises BacnetProtocolError
    /// with OBJECT / UNKNOWN_OBJECT when nothing has that identifier, OBJECT
    /// / OPTIONAL_FUNCTIONALITY_NOT_SUPPORTED when it is not an Audit Log,
    /// and DEVICE / OPERATIONAL_PROBLEM without a valid clock or when the
    /// commit fails; the log is then left as it was. RuntimeError when the
    /// server is not running.
