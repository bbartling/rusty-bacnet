    /// `positive_access_rules` and `negative_access_rules` set the two rule
    /// arrays as lists of `AccessRule` mappings. A rule's `enable` (a bool)
    /// is required. Its `time_range`, when given, names the property that
    /// decides when the rule applies, as a mapping of `object_identifier`,
    /// `property_identifier` and the optional `property_array_index` and
    /// `device_identifier`; left out or `None`, the rule applies at any time.
    /// Its `location`, when given, limits it to one Access Point or one
    /// Access Zone, as an `ObjectIdentifier` or a `(device, object)` pair;
    /// left out or `None`, it covers every access point.
    ///
    /// `enable` sets the object's Enable flag (property 133, `LOG_ENABLE`),
    /// TRUE when omitted; FALSE disables every rule in both arrays.
    ///
    /// `accompaniment` serves the optional Accompaniment row (#1393): the
    /// Access Rights, Access Credential or Access User object a second
    /// credential has to match, as an `ObjectIdentifier` or a
    /// `(device, object)` pair. Instance 4194303 asks for no accompaniment.
    /// Left out or `None`, the object has no such row, and clients can't
    /// add one; once served, they can write it.
    ///
    /// With `storage_path` (a `str`), a rule array, Enable or Accompaniment
    /// that a client writes is kept in that file and restored when the
    /// server is built again. It then wins over the keyword given here,
    /// which is checked but not applied, and a saved Accompaniment is served
    /// even without the keyword. To lift a saved requirement, write the
    /// no-accompaniment reference (instance 4194303), which keeps the row;
    /// to drop the row, remove the storage file, which also drops the saved
    /// rules and Enable. A write that cannot be saved is refused
    /// with DEVICE / OPERATIONAL_PROBLEM, and the old value stays. Without
    /// it, writes live in memory only. Give each object its own file: one
    /// that holds another object's state, or that this backend did not
    /// write, raises BacnetError here, and one holding a rule or an
    /// Accompaniment the object refuses raises BacnetProtocolError.
    ///
    /// A wrong shape or type raises TypeError, an unknown or missing key or a
    /// device that isn't a Device raises ValueError, and a location or an
    /// accompaniment naming another object type raises a protocol error
    /// (VALUE_OUT_OF_RANGE), as does a list of more than 1024 rules
    /// (NO_SPACE_TO_WRITE_PROPERTY). Nothing is registered after any of them.
