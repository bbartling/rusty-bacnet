//! The bridge from Tokio futures to asyncio futures, and the exit gate that
//! keeps binding threads out of a finalizing interpreter (#1002).
//!
//! Binding futures run on this module's Tokio runtime, and its threads touch
//! Python only through [`attach`]: to build a result, and to complete the
//! asyncio future. An `atexit` hook, which CPython runs before it starts
//! finalizing, closes the gate and waits, with the GIL released, until no
//! binding thread is attached. After that a binding thread leaves Python alone
//! and drops what it holds (PyO3 defers those decrefs), so once finalization
//! begins no binding thread is inside the interpreter or about to re-enter it.
//!
//! Checking for finalization when attaching (`Python::try_attach`) is not
//! enough. Completing an asyncio future from another thread calls
//! `loop.call_soon_threadsafe`, which queues the callback and then writes the
//! loop's self-pipe with the GIL released. In that window the loop thread can
//! run the callback, finish the program and start finalizing. CPython 3.12 and
//! 3.13 end a non-main thread that takes the GIL back during finalization with
//! `pthread_exit`, and its forced unwind drops the thread's Python references
//! without the GIL while the interpreter is torn down: a segfault at exit.
