//! An object's save writer together with the writes staged on it (#1270).
//!
//! The Notification Forwarder, the Notification Class and the Access Rights
//! object share this part of the pattern the [module documentation](super)
//! describes: the writes a request stages keep the state they leave aside
//! while their save runs, each write then takes its state or the save's
//! error, and a staged write its request never makes is dropped and
//! corrected.
//!
//! # One save per request (#1423)
//!
//! A request can make several writes to one object: a WritePropertyMultiple
//! that provisions an Access Rights object writes both rule arrays and
//! Enable. The object folds them into one staged save. [`steps`] works out,
//! in the request's order, the state each write leaves on top of the ones
//! before it; a write the object will refuse ends the list, since the
//! request makes no write after it, and a NULL the object refuses as the
//! wrong datatype changes nothing, so the list goes on past it (#1396). One
//! save holds the state the last write leaves. Each write then takes its own
//! step as the request makes it, so the object serves the last step only
//! once every write has been made. A request that stops part way keeps the
//! steps it took, and the release puts storage back to that served state,
//! as for a staged write never made.
//!
//! # A write that won't be made (#1424)
//!
//! A staged write gives way to another write only once that write is sure to
//! be made. [`claim`](StagedSaves::claim) never drops a staged write; the
//! object first works out the state the incoming write leaves, and
//! [drops](StagedSaves::drop_staged) a staged write it doesn't take only
//! when it does. A write the object refuses, and a NULL the server answers
//! as a success that changes nothing, leave another request's staged write
//! in place.
//!
//! A request can vanish between its stage and its write: the server's
//! `stop()` aborts requests, and an application can drop a local write's
//! future. Its staged write then lingers, and storage may hold a state the
//! object never served. Two checks drop it once
//! [`STAGED_WRITE_LIFETIME`] has passed since
//! its save finished: the next stage of a write to the object
//! ([`busy`](StagedSaves::busy)), and the object's call from the server's
//! once-a-second operation task ([`expire`](StagedSaves::expire)), which
//! measures the lifetime on that task's monotonic clock. Either way the
//! object then saves the state it serves.
//!
//! Neither check runs once the server has stopped, so two more cover the
//! end of an object's life (#1363). The server's `stop()`, once it has
//! joined every request, drops what is still staged
//! ([`drop_forgotten`](StagedSaves::drop_forgotten)) and waits for the
//! correcting save. And an object dropped with a write still staged puts
//! storage back as it goes: `StagedSaves` keeps, beside the staged write,
//! the state the object served at its latest storage call, and its `Drop`
//! saves that state, unless the staged save failed, before the writer's own
//! drop joins the thread. An object that stages through `StagedSaves` gets
//! this without a `Drop` of its own; [`stage`](StagedSaves::stage) takes
//! the served state, and [`correct`](StagedSaves::correct) keeps it current.
