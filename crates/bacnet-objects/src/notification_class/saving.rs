//! When a Notification Class saves its Recipient_List (Clause 12.21.8,
//! #1315).
//!
//! A class built with [`NotificationClass::with_persistence`] saves a written
//! Recipient_List before serving it, and refuses a write it cannot save with
//! DEVICE / OPERATIONAL_PROBLEM, keeping the old list. This is the
//! Notification Forwarder's scheme ([`crate::durable`]), shared with it
//! through `StagedSaves`: the bundled server stages the write, the save runs
//! on the class's writer thread while the database guard is dropped, and the
//! write then takes the saved list without saving again. A
//! WritePropertyMultiple that writes the list more than once stages one
//! save of the last (#1423). A write that was not staged queues its save and
//! waits for it where it is.
//!
//! A staged write its request releases without making is dropped, and the
//! class at once queues a save of the list it serves, so storage goes back to
//! that list. A staged write whose request vanished without releasing it, as
//! when `stop()` aborts a request or an application drops a local write's
//! future, is dropped the same way once
//! [`STAGED_WRITE_LIFETIME`](crate::durable::STAGED_WRITE_LIFETIME) has
//! passed since its save finished: by the next write that stages, or by the
//! server's once-a-second operation task, which calls
//! `advance_monotonic_time_internal`. The class saves nothing else between
//! writes.
//!
//! Neither runs once the server has stopped. So `stop()`, once it has
//! joined its requests, drops a staged write that is still held and waits
//! for the save of the served list, and a class dropped with one still
//! held saves the served list as it goes, unless the staged save failed
//! (#1363). Either way a restart serves the list the class served.
//!
//! A written list wins over the destinations the application configures:
//! once a write has set the list and it was saved, a rebuilt class serves the
//! saved list, and [`add_destination`](NotificationClass::add_destination)
//! checks a destination without adding it. The configured destinations are
//! never saved.
