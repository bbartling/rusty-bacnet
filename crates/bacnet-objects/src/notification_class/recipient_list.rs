/// The most destinations a Notification Class Recipient_List holds (#1098).
///
/// A site usually routes a class to a few front ends, operator workstations
/// or gateways, and the AE-CRL-B building block (Annex K.2.25) asks for room
/// for at least 8, so 32 leaves ample headroom. The bound also keeps the list
/// small on the wire. A destination naming a device encodes in at most 27
/// octets, and one naming an address with a MAC of up to 6 octets in at most
/// 35, so a full list of either kind takes at most 1,120 octets and a
/// ReadProperty of it fits B/IP's 1476-octet APDU unsegmented. An address
/// MAC is at most [`BACnetAddress::MAX_MAC_LEN`] octets (#1124), so no
/// destination takes more than 47 octets and no full list more than 1,504.
///
/// A write that would leave more destinations fails with RESOURCES /
/// NO_SPACE_TO_WRITE_PROPERTY, naming the first destination past the cap;
/// AddListElement reports that as NO_SPACE_TO_ADD_LIST_ELEMENT at the request
/// element that brought it (Clause 15.1.1.3). `add_destination` refuses the
/// same way, without the element.
///
/// Routing holds every Notification Class to the same bound, so each event
/// transition fans out to at most this many notifications per class (#1124).
/// Only a custom NOTIFICATION_CLASS object can serve a longer list, and the
/// transition then goes to none of it: see
