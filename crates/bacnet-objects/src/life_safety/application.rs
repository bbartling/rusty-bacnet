//! The application's route to Present_Value and Tracking_Value once a server
//! holds the Point or Zone (#1123).
//!
//! The inherent `set_present_value` and `set_tracking_value` need the
//! concrete type, which the database's `Box<dyn BACnetObject>` hides. The
//! trait hooks `set_present_value_internal` and `set_tracking_value_internal`
//! carry the same updates through the box; `BACnetServer::set_present_value_local`
//! and `set_tracking_value_local` call them and then run the server's COV and
//! event processing.
//!
//! Both hooks take an Enumerated holding a standard BACnetLifeSafetyState or
//! one from the proprietary range 256..=65535, the range a reset commit and an
//! out-of-service Tracking_Value write already enforce. A reserved or larger
//! number fails with PROPERTY / VALUE_OUT_OF_RANGE, any other datatype with
//! PROPERTY / INVALID_DATA_TYPE, and the object is left untouched.
//!
//! How the route fits the rest of the object:
//!
//! - Latching: Clauses 12.15.4 and 12.16.4 leave the derivation of
//!   Present_Value, and whether it holds a non-NORMAL state until a reset, to
//!   the implementation. The application owns that rule here. The object never
//!   computes one property from the other and each hook sets only its own, so
//!   an application that latches keeps Present_Value on the alarm state while
//!   it goes on reporting the live state through Tracking_Value, and its reset
//!   executor commits the Present_Value that follows the reset.
//! - Silenced and Operation_Expected: neither hook changes them. A new state
//!   doesn't unsilence the object or arm a reset by itself, just as a reset
//!   commit infers nothing it wasn't given. The application arms a reset
//!   through `set_life_safety_operation_expected_internal`.
//! - Reset executor: the route takes values whether or not a reset is armed.
//!   The executor and the route are two writers of the same fields, ordered by
//!   the database lock, and the executor's context carries whatever values the
//!   route left.
//! - Out_Of_Service: Tables 12-18 and 12-19 give Present_Value no
//!   out-of-service footnote and Clauses 12.15.11 and 12.16.11 don't decouple
//!   it, so clients never write it and `set_present_value_internal` serves the
//!   new value at once in either state. The Inputs refuse their application
//!   value while out of service because a client owns Present_Value then;
//!   nothing here competes for it. Tracking_Value is decoupled while out of
//!   service (`out_of_service.rs`), so `set_tracking_value_internal` replaces
//!   the value set aside, the client's simulated value keeps being served, and
//!   the application's value takes over on the return to service.
//! - Event reporting: these objects run no intrinsic reporting and Event_State
//!   stays NORMAL, so neither update raises an event. The server's local write
//!   path still runs its post-write event evaluation after both routes, as for
//!   every other `set_present_value_local` caller, so a custom Life Safety
//!   object with intrinsic reporting is evaluated there.
