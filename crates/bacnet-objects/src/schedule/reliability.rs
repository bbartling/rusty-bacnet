//! The Schedule's own Reliability evaluation (#1056, #1086, #1433, #1436).
//!
//! Clause 12.24.13 ties Reliability to the schedule's configuration being
//! consistent, in two halves. When either fails, Reliability is
//! CONFIGURATION_ERROR, and Status_Flags reports FAULT through the usual
//! Reliability mapping.
//!
//! The contents: leaving NULLs aside, every value in Weekly_Schedule,
//! Exception_Schedule and Schedule_Default must be of a single datatype. The
//! object checks this on every change to them.
//!
//! The references: every member of List_Of_Object_Property_References must
//! accept that datatype. Only the target objects can say, so the object
//! learns it from its writes (#1086): the server reports how each target took
//! a write through `complete_schedule_write`, and a member that refused the
//! value for its datatype (INVALID_DATA_TYPE or DATATYPE_NOT_SUPPORTED) faults
//! the Schedule until a later write to it succeeds or it leaves the list. So
//! does a member the target can't write at all, whatever the value (#1433):
//! one naming a missing object or property, or an array index the property
//! can't take (UNKNOWN_OBJECT, UNKNOWN_PROPERTY, PROPERTY_IS_NOT_AN_ARRAY,
//! INVALID_ARRAY_INDEX). Such a member clears once a later write to it
//! succeeds, say after the object is created, or once it leaves the list.
//!
//! The fault therefore shows at the first write, not at configuration time;
//! the clause already lets a remote member's fault wait for a write. Only a
//! value of a datatype the schedule itself holds counts, so a NULL, or a
//! value of another datatype a client wrote to Present_Value out of service,
//! says nothing about the configuration. Any other failure leaves a member's
//! standing as it was: a denied write, for one, can come from the target's
//! state and not its configuration. Deciding beforehand instead would need a
//! model of each target property's datatype, which the objects don't
//! publish, or a guess from the target's current value.
//!
//! A refusal can outlive its cause: the missing object is created later, or the
//! array grows to take the index. The Schedule writes its list only when its
//! value changes, when it enters Effective_Period and when its references or
//! priority change, so a Schedule whose value stays put would never ask again
//! (#1436). So a pass that owes the list nothing still offers the current value
//! to the refused members, and to them only: the members that took it, a
//! Command or Channel among them, are not written again, and the slots the
//! Schedule holds stay as they were. A member that takes the retry clears as
//! after any accepted write. A NULL Present_Value isn't retried, since a NULL
//! never counts here, and nothing is retried out of service or outside
//! Effective_Period, where the calculation sends nothing. Datatype refusals are
//! retried as well as reference refusals: both answer the one question of
//! 12.24.13, and a datatype refusal can pass without the Schedule changing too,
//! when the application puts an object that takes the datatype under the
//! target's identifier. A member that still refuses costs one refused write per
//! pass and changes nothing.
//!
//! A misconfigured schedule keeps evaluating and writing its references.
//! Clause 12.24.4 makes those writes unconditional, Reliability only reports
//! the inconsistency, and a target that cannot take a value refuses that one
//! write without stopping the others. The multi-state objects treat their
//! CONFIGURATION_ERROR the same way.
//!
//! The evaluation owns only the fault it raised. A Reliability applied through
//! `set_reliability_internal` stays until that caller changes it, and while
//! Out_Of_Service is TRUE the client's simulated value is left alone; the
//! return to service restores the saved value and evaluates again. Refusals
//! reported meanwhile are kept for that evaluation.
