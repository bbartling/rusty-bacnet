//! Network writes of List_Of_Object_Property_References and
//! Priority_For_Writing, and what a change to either does to the targets
//! (#1088).
//!
//! Table 12-28 leaves the writability of both properties to the
//! implementation. This object accepts them through WriteProperty and
//! WritePropertyMultiple with the checks the local setters apply; the
//! server's AddListElement and RemoveListElement edit the reference list and
//! write the result back whole through the same path (#1121).
//! Priority_For_Writing takes an Unsigned from 1 to 16 (VALUE_OUT_OF_RANGE
//! otherwise). The reference list arrives as the raw bytes of its
//! BACnetDeviceObjectPropertyReference elements and is decoded by the shared
//! helpers in `device_reference.rs` (#1313). Each refusal names its member by
//! position (`common::at_list_element`), so AddListElement can report the
//! request element behind it. The checks run in three passes, and the first
//! refusal of the first pass that refuses anything is the answer: the whole
//! list is decoded (a member whose first tag is not the context `[0]` object
//! identifier is INVALID_DATA_TYPE, one that starts right but doesn't decode
//! INVALID_DATA_ENCODING), then its length is held to [`MAX_REFERENCES`]
//! (NO_SPACE_TO_WRITE_PROPERTY, naming the first member past it), then each
//! member's Device member is checked in order. So a malformed member, or the
//! cap, wins over a Device refusal of an earlier member.
//!
//! A Device member that isn't a Device identifier is VALUE_OUT_OF_RANGE
//! (#1308). Any other Device member is OPTIONAL_FUNCTIONALITY_NOT_SUPPORTED,
//! the error Clause 12.24.10 names for a Schedule that serves only objects of
//! its own device. That is this object's profile: it writes local targets
//! only and stores references without a Device member. The object can't tell
//! which Device holds it, so the bundled server removes a Device identifier
//! that names its own Device before the value gets here (#1122); what reaches
//! this check names another device, or comes from a caller outside the
//! server. A refused write changes nothing.
//!
//! What a change does is left to the implementation; the choices here:
//!
//! - The new list, at the new priority, gets the current Present_Value as
//!   soon as the object writes at all. In service, the next calculation
//!   inside Effective_Period sends it, as entering the period does, and
//!   outside the period nothing is sent. Out of service it goes out as a
//!   value a client writes would. The bundled server runs that pass at once
//!   after a write commits.
//! - The slots the change leaves behind are relinquished with a NULL at the
//!   priority they hold: on each dropped member, or on every member when the
//!   priority moves. Otherwise the targets would keep a command at a priority
//!   no writer owns any more.
//! - Only slots this Schedule still holds are relinquished: those filled by
//!   its last write, of a value other than NULL, while it has stayed active
//!   since. Leaving Effective_Period gives them up. Clause 12.24.6 has
//!   seasonal Schedules share references and a priority, each writing only in
//!   its own period, so an out-of-season Schedule whose list or priority is
//!   edited must not clear the command of the one in season.
//! - Every accepted write counts as a change, even of the value already
//!   held; sending the current value again is harmless.
