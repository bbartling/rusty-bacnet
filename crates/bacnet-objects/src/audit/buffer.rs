//! Resizing and purging an Audit Log (#1238).
//!
//! Buffer_Size is writable, but only while Log_Enable is FALSE (Clause
//! 12.64.9). The clause leaves the records already held to the
//! implementation. This log keeps the newest of them, as many as the new
//! size holds: the records its ring would hold had it been that size all
//! along. Growing the buffer therefore loses nothing, and shrinking it drops
//! the oldest records without a status record, as an overflowing ring does;
//! their sequence numbers stay unused.
//!
//! No peer can empty an Audit Log. Its Record_Count is read-only, unlike the
//! other logs' (Clause 12.64.11), and Clause 12.64.10 gives no other way to
//! reset one. The application purges it instead, through
//! [`AuditLogObject::purge`] or the bundled server's `purge_audit_log`. The
//! purge leaves one BUFFER_PURGED status record, which also carries
//! LOG_DISABLED while logging is off; it is written either way, since a
//! log-status record ignores Log_Enable (Clause 12.64.10). Total_Record_Count
//! and the completed receipts survive the purge, so sequence numbers
//! keep counting and a confirmed notification sent again after it is still
//! recognized as a duplicate.
//!
//! Both changes reach storage before the log serves them, through the same
//! writer as every other commit ([`super::staging`]). A commit that fails
//! refuses the change with DEVICE / OPERATIONAL_PROBLEM and leaves the log as
//! it was.
