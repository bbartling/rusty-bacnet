//! Audit Log commits off the database lock (#1270).
//!
//! Every commit runs on the log's writer thread ([`crate::durable`]). The
//! server stages an inbound notification batch, a Log_Enable or Buffer_Size
//! write it receives, and an application's purge (#1238): the log builds the
//! next snapshot and queues its commit, goes on serving the committed state,
//! and takes the new snapshot only once the commit is durable. The server
//! awaits the commit after dropping the database guard, so readers carry on
//! meanwhile, and a confirmed batch is still acknowledged only after its
//! records and receipt are stored. A commit that fails leaves the log as it
//! was, and the request is refused.
//!
//! A request's Log_Enable and Buffer_Size writes are staged together: one
//! commit holds them all, and the log keeps the state each leaves as a step
//! the request takes when it makes that write. If the request stops before
//! taking every step, the log keeps what it took and storage is set back to
//! the state served.
//!
//! One commit is staged at a time; a request that finds one staged waits for
//! it without the guard. Code that changes the log in place (an
//! application's `add_record`, or a change nobody staged) first settles what
//! is staged: a batch whose commit ran is applied if it succeeded, its
//! outcome kept for the batch's request, and a staged change is dropped, its
//! request then committing in place.
