//! A Notification Forwarder's Subscribed_Recipients (Clause 12.51.9, #1049):
//! a bounded BACnetLIST of BACnetEventNotificationSubscription whose entries
//! lapse when their time runs out.
//!
//! The stack bundles no Notification Forwarder object. The placeholder was
//! withdrawn because it forwarded nothing (#188), and the object stays
//! unsupported until forwarding exists. An application that implements one
//! keeps the property in a [`SubscribedRecipients`] and routes to it the
//! property's reads and writes ([`read`](SubscribedRecipients::read) and
//! [`write`](SubscribedRecipients::write)) and the object's monotonic clock
//! hooks ([`bind_monotonic_clock`](SubscribedRecipients::bind_monotonic_clock),
//! [`advance_to`](SubscribedRecipients::advance_to) and
//! [`next_deadline`](SubscribedRecipients::next_deadline)). The server then
//! serves the list to ReadProperty, ReadPropertyMultiple and ReadRange, and
//! its AddListElement and RemoveListElement handlers edit it the way the
//! clause asks: an entry is named by its recipient and process identifier, and
//! adding one already present renews it with the other members given.
//!
//! # Lifetimes
//!
//! Time Remaining travels in minutes. The store keeps each entry's deadline on
//! the database's monotonic clock, the one the server's operation task uses
//! for the Access Door's pulse relock, and serves the whole minutes left,
//! rounded up, so a live entry never reads as zero. An entry leaves the list
//! once its deadline passes: reads and writes skip it from then on, and the
//! server's operation task drops it at its deadline (through
//! `advance_monotonic_time_internal`). With no clock bound the store counts
//! the time [`advance_by`](SubscribedRecipients::advance_by) gives it.
//!
//! Clause 12.51.9 asks for the list to survive a restart. The store keeps it
//! in memory only, like the rest of the object model.
