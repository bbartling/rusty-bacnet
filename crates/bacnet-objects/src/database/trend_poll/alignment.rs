//! Clock-aligned acquisition for a POLLED Trend Log Multiple (Clauses
//! 12.30.14 and 12.30.15).
//!
//! Boundaries are counted on the Device clock's local time: boundary `k`
//! falls `k * interval + offset` hundredths after midnight on 1970-01-01,
//! local time. The interval divides a day, so every day's boundaries sit at
//! the same times of day and the count runs on across midnight. Each pass
//! looks at the Device clock again: a boundary is due once the clock has
//! reached one past the boundary last served, so the plan follows the Device
//! clock rather than a deadline on the monotonic clock. When the Device clock
//! has jumped since the last look (set by hand, a time synchronization, a
//! daylight-saving change), the plan starts again from where the clock now
//! stands: the boundaries a forward jump skipped are not made up off the
//! grid, and the ones a backward jump repeats are logged again as the clock
//! reaches them.
