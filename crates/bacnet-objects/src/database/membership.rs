//! Work a change of the database's membership leaves for the server (#1341,
//! #1440).
//!
//! Adding, replacing or removing an object can change others: a Pulse
//! Converter whose Input_Reference names it is judged again
//! (`input_references.rs`), and its Reliability can change with the verdict.
//! The database makes that change at once, under the caller's exclusive
//! access. Adding one can also let a Schedule's refused reference to it
//! through, but the Schedule's writes to its targets are the server's
//! (`crate::traits::BACnetObject::retry_refusals_naming` builds them). So the
//! database queues the objects that changed and the Schedules owed a retry,
//! and calls the waker the server installed. The server takes the queue
//! under its next database guard, makes the retries and fans COV out: at
//! once after a CreateObject or DeleteObject, and from a background task
//! after an application's own `add` or `remove`.
//!
//! The queue holds each entry once, and a retry only while a Schedule holds
//! a refusal naming the object. Without a server nothing takes it, so it
//! stays bounded by the objects and refusals that can produce entries.
