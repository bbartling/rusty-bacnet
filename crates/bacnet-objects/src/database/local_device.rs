//! Which Device a database speaks for, and which device-qualified references
//! stay inside it (#1183, #1184).
//!
//! Many references carry an optional Device member: a Trend Log's
//! Log_DeviceObjectProperty, an Event Enrollment's monitored and setpoint
//! references, a Schedule's targets and more. Without the member, or with one
//! naming this device, the reference points at an object in this database.
//! With one naming any other device it points somewhere this database can't
//! read, even when an object with the same identifier exists here. The object
//! layer (the Trend Log poller) and the server (Event Enrollment evaluation,
//! local reference rewrites) ask that question of the same objects, so the
//! answer lives with the database rather than in each caller.
