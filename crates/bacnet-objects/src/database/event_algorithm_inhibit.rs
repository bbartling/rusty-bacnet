//! Following an Event_Algorithm_Inhibit_Ref (#1329).
//!
//! An intrinsic reporter can't see the object its reference names, so the
//! database reads the property for it. The reference is a
//! BACnetObjectPropertyReference, which has no device member, so it only
//! ever names a property of this device; there is nothing remote to read.
//! The clauses that define the pair (Clause 12.2.31 and its counterparts)
//! expect a Boolean or a BinaryPV there, map ACTIVE to TRUE and INACTIVE to
//! FALSE, and take a property that doesn't exist as FALSE.
//!
//! A read only says Enumerated, not which enumeration, and an Event_State
//! of FAULT or a Reliability of NO_SENSOR is Enumerated 1 as well. So the
//! inhibit is TRUE only for a Boolean TRUE, or for an ACTIVE read from a
//! property [`holds_binary_pv`] knows as a BinaryPV: Present_Value,
//! Relinquish_Default, an element of Priority_Array, Alarm_Value and
//! Feedback_Value on the binary types that have them, and an Access
//! Credential's Credential_Status. Anything else, a property this device
//! can't read included, is FALSE.
//!
//! The bundled server follows the reference every time it evaluates the
//! object: the evaluation a write of the object runs, and the one-second
//! tick every intrinsic reporter gets. A change to the referenced property
//! therefore reaches Event_Algorithm_Inhibit, and the algorithm, within a
//! second, and a read of Event_Algorithm_Inhibit returns the value as of
//! the last evaluation. Both reads happen under the database guard the
//! evaluation already holds, so following takes no lock of its own.
