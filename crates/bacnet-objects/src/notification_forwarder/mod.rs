//! Notification Forwarder object (type 51, Clause 12.51).
//!
//! A forwarder originates no events. It takes the event notifications this
//! device receives, and those its own objects address to the local Device,
//! and sends each one on to the destinations it holds: the configured
//! Recipient_List and the expiring Subscribed_Recipients. The server does the
//! sending; see [`forwarding_targets`] for which notifications a forwarder
//! takes and where it sends them.
//!
//! # Rows
//!
//! The object serves every required row of Table 12-58, plus Description and,
//! when the application configures one, Port_Filter. Over the network:
//!
//! - Recipient_List takes the same writes as a Notification Class's, capped
//!   at [`MAX_RECIPIENT_LIST_DESTINATIONS`] destinations.
//! - Subscribed_Recipients is a [`SubscribedRecipients`] store: entries run
//!   out after their Time Remaining and are edited by AddListElement and
//!   RemoveListElement.
//! - Process_Identifier_Filter takes an Unsigned32, or NULL to forward every
//!   process identifier; Local_Forwarding_Only and Out_Of_Service take a
//!   BOOLEAN.
//! - Port_Filter takes writes of its Enabled members only (Clause 12.51.11):
//!   the array keeps its size and Port_IDs.
//! - Reliability is always NO_FAULT_DETECTED and is not writable.
//!
//! # Restarts
//!
//! Clauses 12.51.8 and 12.51.9 ask for both lists to survive a restart. A
//! forwarder built with [`NotificationForwarderObject::with_persistence`]
//! saves Recipient_List and Subscribed_Recipients together, each
//! subscription with the minutes it has left, when a write changes either
//! list, when an entry lapses, and at most once a minute while the minutes
//! the entries serve fall; it restores both when built again. A restored
//! entry counts down from its saved minutes: no fewer than it had left when
//! the device stopped, about a minute more at most, and never more than its
//! last subscription gave it, so restarts do not keep an entry alive.
//!
//! Saves run on the forwarder's own writer thread, never while the database
//! guard is held ([`crate::durable`]), and a list write that cannot be saved
//! is refused with DEVICE / OPERATIONAL_PROBLEM, leaving the old list. A
//! failed save is logged and counted ([`ForwarderSaveCounters`]); one the
//! operation task made is retried a minute later.
//!
//! A written Recipient_List wins over the one the application configures:
//! once a write has set the list and it was saved, a rebuilt forwarder
//! serves the saved list and ignores [`add_destination`] calls. Until then
//! the configured destinations apply at every start; they are not saved. A
//! forwarder built with [`NotificationForwarderObject::new`] keeps both lists
//! in memory only.
//!
//! [`add_destination`]: NotificationForwarderObject::add_destination
