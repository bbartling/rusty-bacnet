//! Keeping a forwarder's Recipient_List and Subscribed_Recipients across a
//! restart (Clauses 12.51.8 and 12.51.9).
//!
//! Like [`AuditLogPersistence`](crate::audit::AuditLogPersistence), the
//! storage belongs to the application. The forwarder loads it once, when it is
//! built, and saves both lists whenever either changes. Saves run on the
//! forwarder's own writer thread. The bundled server waits for them with the
//! database guard dropped; a write nobody staged waits where it is
//! ([`crate::durable`] lists those paths). Each saved Subscribed_Recipients
//! entry carries the whole minutes it had left at the save.
