/// - its Local_Forwarding_Only is FALSE, or the notification came from one of

///   enables that port. A forwarder without Port_Filter takes from the one
///   port a device that does not route has.
///
/// A forwarder that cannot serve one of these properties as the clause types
/// it takes nothing. Its destinations are the Recipient_List entries whose
/// days, times and transitions admit the notification, filtered as a
/// Notification Class filters its own, and every live Subscribed_Recipients
/// entry. A list that does not decode, or runs past its cap, contributes
/// nothing rather than a part of itself.

/// global broadcast, none back onto the network a broadcast came from) need
/// each destination's route, so the server applies them as it sends.
