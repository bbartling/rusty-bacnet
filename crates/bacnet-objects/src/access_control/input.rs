//! The inputs an application reports for its access-control objects while
//! the server holds them (#1132).
//!
//! An Access Point's access events, a Credential Data Input's reads and an
//! Access Door's hardware state come from outside BACnet: the application's
//! access logic, its card readers, its door contacts and lock monitors. None
//! of them takes a network write in service. Each object takes its own
//! record through [`BACnetObject::report_access_input_internal`], whose
//! values change together. The server's `report_access_event_local`,
//! `report_credential_read_local` and `report_door_state_local` hand the
//! record over as one local write, so the COV report and the event pass
//! follow it as they follow any other.
//!
//! While Out_Of_Service is TRUE an object stands apart from what it
//! represents (Clauses 12.26.9, 12.31.8 and 12.36.8): the point performs no
//! authentication, and a client may be simulating the door's or the
//! reader's values. So the route refuses an input then, with
//! WRITE_ACCESS_DENIED, and changes nothing; the application reports the
//! state again after the return to service. The objects' own setters keep
//! their rules, for setting an object up before the server holds it.
//!
