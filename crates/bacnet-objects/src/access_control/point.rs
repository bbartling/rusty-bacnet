// AccessPointObject (type 33)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/// BACnet Access Point object (type 33).
///
/// Represents an access point (reader/controller at a door) in an access control system.
/// The most recent access event is Access_Event; Table 12-36 has no
/// Present_Value row, so the object serves none (#1064).
///
/// Each change of Out_Of_Service is an access event of the point's own
/// (Clause 12.31.8; #1248): entering out of service records OUT_OF_SERVICE
/// and the return to service OUT_OF_SERVICE_RELINQUISHED. Recording one
/// follows Clause 12.31.27.1, which moves Access_Event_Tag on when an event
/// starts a new access transaction and stamps Access_Event_Time with the
/// current date and time. The introduction to Clause 12.31 counts an
/// operator action as an access transaction, so each change of
/// Out_Of_Service starts a new one: the tag moves on by one (wrapping at the
/// top of the Unsigned range), and the time comes from the Device clock. A
/// write that leaves Out_Of_Service as it was, NULL included, records
/// nothing. No credential or factor belongs to an edge, so each one stores
/// the no-credential reference in Access_Event_Credential (Clause 12.31.30)
/// and the UNDEFINED factor in Access_Event_Authentication_Factor (Clause
/// 12.31.31).
///
/// The application's own access events reach a point the server holds
/// through `BACnetServer::report_access_event_local` (#1132), which refuses
/// them while Out_Of_Service is TRUE: the point then performs no
/// authentication or authorization (Clause 12.31.8), so it has no events of
/// its own to report.
///
/// Authentication_Status is the status the application reports for its
/// authentication process (Clause 12.31.9; #1284), READY until it reports
/// another. While Out_Of_Service is TRUE no authentication runs, so the
/// property reads DISABLED; the reported status is kept and served again on
/// the return to service.
///
/// With no usable Device clock the time takes the BACnetTimeStamp
/// sequence-number form (Clauses 12.31.29 and 21.6) and holds the new tag:
/// the tag itself while it fits the form's 1 to 65535, and past that the tag
/// folded back into that range, so successive edges still differ and none
/// reads 0, the value of an update time with no update yet.
///
/// Access_Event_Time is the Table 13-1 trigger, and each edge moves it, so
/// each edge sends the SubscribeCOV report, which also carries the changed
/// OUT_OF_SERVICE flag. That holds for a round trip in one
/// WritePropertyMultiple too, where Status_Flags ends where it started. The
/// point runs no intrinsic reporting (no ACCESS_EVENT algorithm;
/// Event_State stays NORMAL), so an edge raises no event notification.
///
/// Active_Authentication_Policy, Number_Of_Authentication_Policies,
/// Authentication_Policy_List, Authentication_Policy_Names,
/// Authorization_Mode and Priority_For_Writing hold the settings the
/// application's authentication and authorization work from (#1307, #1325).
/// A client picks the policy in effect and the authorization mode; the
/// application sets the policies, the modes it carries out and the door
/// command priority. The module `point_authorization` has the rules.
///
/// Reliability is CONFIGURATION_ERROR while Active_Authentication_Policy is
/// zero, which happens when the policies leave none usable in effect
/// (Clause 12.31.10), and NO_FAULT_DETECTED otherwise. Since it can leave
/// NO_FAULT_DETECTED, a client may write it while Out_Of_Service is TRUE
/// to simulate a fault, and only then (Clause 12.31.8): an Enumerated
/// inside the BACnetReliability production, else INVALID_DATA_TYPE or
/// VALUE_OUT_OF_RANGE, and WRITE_ACCESS_DENIED in service. Out of service
/// the value served stays decoupled from the policies: it starts as the
/// value served at the edge, follows only those writes, and the return to
/// service serves the derived value again. Status_Flags carries FAULT from
/// the value served.
