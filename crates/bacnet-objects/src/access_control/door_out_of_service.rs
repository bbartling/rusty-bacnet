//! Door_Status, Lock_Status, Door_Alarm_State and Reliability while
//! Out_Of_Service is TRUE (Clauses 12.26.8, 12.26.9, 12.26.12, 12.26.13 and
//! 12.26.20, Table 12-30 footnote 1, #1131, #1149).
//!
//! Footnote 1 of Table 12-30 marks the first three rows, so a client can
//! simulate the door by writing them. Clause 12.26.9 adds Reliability for a
//! door whose Reliability can leave NO_FAULT_DETECTED, and this one can: the
//! FAULT_STATE check on Fault_Values (`door_alarm`, #1149) moves it to
//! MULTI_STATE_FAULT. The door takes WriteProperty and WritePropertyMultiple
//! of the four only while Out_Of_Service is TRUE and refuses them with
//! WRITE_ACCESS_DENIED in service. Each write has to be an Enumerated inside
//! its Clause 21 production: a named BACnetDoorStatus or one from the
//! proprietary range 1024..=65535, a named BACnetLockStatus (the production
//! is closed and Table 23-1 doesn't list it, so it has no proprietary range),
//! a named BACnetDoorAlarmState or one from 256..=65535, or a
//! BACnetReliability, its proprietary range included. Any other number is
//! VALUE_OUT_OF_RANGE and any other datatype INVALID_DATA_TYPE, with the
//! property left as it was.
//!
//! A simulated Door_Alarm_State also has to be one the door may hold (Clause
//! 12.26.20): NORMAL or a member of Alarm_Values or Fault_Values, and no
//! member of Masked_Alarm_Values. Any other state is VALUE_OUT_OF_RANGE, as
//! it is from the application.
//!
//! Out of service these values stop following the device, so the door keeps
//! the device's own values to one side:
//!
//! - On the FALSE-to-TRUE edge it puts aside the values it serves
//!   (`common::write_out_of_service_with_restore`). The device has no
//!   Reliability of its own to put aside: in service the FAULT_STATE check
//!   decides it.
//! - Meanwhile a value the application reports (`set_door_status`,
//!   `set_lock_status`, `set_door_alarm_state`) replaces the value put aside,
//!   not the one served.
//! - On the TRUE-to-FALSE edge the values put aside come back, so the
//!   device's state is served again at once and the simulated values, a
//!   simulated Reliability included, are gone.
//!
//! How a simulated value reaches the rest of the door and the server:
//!
//! - COV: Door_Alarm_State is a trigger of the Access Door row of Table 13-1
//!   (#1061), and the server compares the row's values around every committed
//!   write, so a simulated Door_Alarm_State sends a SubscribeCOV report, as the
//!   return to service does when it restores a different value. Door_Status
//!   and Lock_Status aren't in that row and send none by themselves. A
//!   simulated fault reports through the FAULT flag of Status_Flags.
//! - Pulse relock: Door_Pulse_Time and Door_Extended_Pulse_Time relinquish a
//!   pulse from the priority array on a timer armed by the command (#1073).
//!   Nothing reads Door_Status, Lock_Status or Door_Alarm_State to relinquish
//!   early or to hold the slot, so a simulated value neither drives nor delays
//!   the relock, and the relock leaves the simulated values alone.
//! - Event reporting: the CHANGE_OF_STATE algorithm watches the
//!   Door_Alarm_State and Reliability served (#1149), and while no
//!   Reliability is simulated the FAULT_STATE check reads the
//!   Door_Alarm_State served. A simulated alarm state therefore raises an
//!   offnormal event, and a simulated fault value or Reliability a fault one,
//!   the way Clause 12.26.9 has anything depending on these values follow
//!   the simulation.
//! - Secured_Status: each read derives it from the served Door_Status and
//!   Lock_Status, among other inputs (`AccessDoorObject::secured_status`,
//!   #1148). A simulated value moves it as a device report would, and the
//!   return to service moves it back with the device's values.
