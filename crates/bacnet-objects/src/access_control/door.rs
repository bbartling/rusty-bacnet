/// A PULSE_UNLOCK or EXTENDED_PULSE_UNLOCK command holds its priority slot
/// for Door_Pulse_Time or Door_Extended_Pulse_Time and is then relinquished,
/// so the door relocks (Clauses 12.26.4, 12.26.16 and 12.26.17; #1073). The
/// deadline is taken from the database's monotonic clock when the command is
/// written, and the server's monotonic operation task relinquishes the slot
/// at that deadline, the mechanism Binary Lighting Output egress uses. A
/// pulse written below a priority already commanded is relinquished at once,
/// and a pulse time of zero relinquishes at once too. Changing a pulse time
/// leaves an armed deadline as it was.
///
/// While Out_Of_Service is TRUE a client can simulate Door_Status,
/// Lock_Status and Door_Alarm_State by writing them, and the door's own values
/// come back on the return to service (Clause 12.26.9, Table 12-30 footnote 1;
/// #1131). The module `door_out_of_service` has the details.
///
/// Secured_Status isn't stored: each read works it out from what the door
/// serves (Clause 12.26.14; #1148), so it moves with every command, relock,
/// device report and simulated value. See `secured_status` for how the
/// inputs combine and when the answer is UNKNOWN.
///
/// The door reports intrinsically on Door_Alarm_State with the
/// CHANGE_OF_STATE algorithm (Clause 12.26; #1149): Event_State goes
/// OFFNORMAL once Door_Alarm_State has stayed in Alarm_Values for Time_Delay
/// seconds and back to NORMAL once it has stayed out of them for
/// Time_Delay_Normal. Fault_Values feeds the FAULT_STATE algorithm, so a
/// Door_Alarm_State among them makes Reliability MULTI_STATE_FAULT and
/// Event_State FAULT. Masked_Alarm_Values keeps Door_Alarm_State out of the
/// states it lists. The module `door_alarm` has the rules the three lists
/// set; the event rows are served and written through
/// `ChangeOfStateReporting`, and the server sends the notifications to the
/// Notification Class recipients.
///
/// The application decides when the door is in alarm and reports it with
/// [`Self::set_door_alarm_state`]; Clause 12.26.20 leaves that to the
/// device. While the server holds the door, the application reports its
/// Door_Status, Lock_Status and Door_Alarm_State through
/// `BACnetServer::report_door_state_local` (#1132), which refuses them while
/// Out_Of_Service is TRUE. That includes DOOR_OPEN_TOO_LONG: the door serves
/// Door_Open_Too_Long_Time for the application's logic to read but runs no
