//! Running a test again when its closing release probe loses the port (#1070).
//!
//! A test that stops a node and then binds the node's old address, to prove the
//! node let it go, leaves a gap between the two in which another process can
//! take the port. The probe then fails although the node released the port.
//! [`rerun_on_lost_port`] runs such a test again from the start; the node binds
//! fresh ports each run, so one that really keeps its port fails every run.
//!
//! The benchmarks' standalone-binary tests include this file by path.
