//! SourceReporter hands every `BACnetObject` method to the object it wraps
//! (#1097). The rows and the probe are shared with DeviceReadView's tests in
//! bacnet-server, and the trait's methods are read from its source: a method
//! added there fails `every_bacnet_object_method_has_a_forwarding_row` until
//! it has a row, and `every_method_reaches_the_wrapped_object` until
//! SourceReporter forwards it, arguments and answer unchanged.
