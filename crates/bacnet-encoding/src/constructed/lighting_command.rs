//! Clause 21 codec for `BACnetLightingCommand`: a Lighting Output's
//! Lighting_Command (Clause 12.54), and the one constructed alternative of a
//! BACnetChannelValue, where it sits inside an opening and closing tag 0 (see
//! `channel_value.rs`).
//!
//! The SEQUENCE has no frame of its own. The operation comes first under
//! primitive context tag 0, then any of five optional fields in ascending tag
//! order: REALs under tags 1 to 3 (target level, ramp rate, step increment)
//! and Unsigneds under tags 4 and 5 (fade time, priority).
