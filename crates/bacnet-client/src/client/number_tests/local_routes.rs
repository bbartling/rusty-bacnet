//! Once the client has learned its network's number, a routed request or a
//! network broadcast naming that number goes out as local traffic (#1358):
//! a unicast to the destination MAC, or a local broadcast, with no DNET. A
//! routed confirmed request is then answered from that MAC with no SNET, or
//! relayed back by a router with this network as its SNET and that MAC as
//! its SADR, and either answer completes it (#1465). The peer's limits still
//! come from its routed device-table row, and a request past them is refused
//! or segmented locally. Another network keeps its DNET, and so does every
//! network while the number is unknown.
//!
//! The peer is `[3]`, behind router `[9]` when routed. The number is learned
//! through the client's own Network-Number-Is intake.
