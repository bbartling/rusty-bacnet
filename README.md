# Rusty BACnet

A BACnet protocol stack written in Rust, with Python bindings and a command-line
tool. Use it to build BACnet clients, model devices and serve their objects, or
explore protocol behavior in a local lab. It targets ASHRAE Standard 135-2020.
It isn't BTL certified; [Conformance](#conformance) explains what is covered.

## Features

- **Async Rust client and server.** Built on Tokio. Transaction handling,
  segmentation, discovery, COV subscriptions, and alarm and event services, with
  the protocol layers split into separate crates you can depend on individually.
- **Object models.** A server-side object database with standard object types,
  property metadata, commandable outputs, intrinsic reporting, and draft PICS
  generation from your server's configuration.
- **Five data links.** BACnet/IP, BACnet/IPv6, BACnet/SC (secure WebSocket/TLS,
  including a hub), MS/TP over serial, and Ethernet on Linux. See
  [Transports](#transports).
- **Routing.** A network layer with router tables, routed requests and BBMD and
  foreign-device support for BACnet/IP.
- **Python bindings.** `BACnetClient`, `BACnetServer`, `ScHub` and the shared
  endpoints with asyncio support, typed enums and values, and async COV notification streams. Python and
  Rust expose different configuration surfaces, so check the Python API before
  assuming a Rust option exists there.
- **CLI.** The `bacnet` tool does discovery, reads and writes, COV
  subscriptions, alarms, file transfer and BBMD management over BACnet/IP,
  BACnet/IPv6 and BACnet/SC, with an interactive shell and optional packet
  capture.
- **Shared endpoints.** One device can send requests and
  answer a limited set of them (ReadProperty by default) through a single
  BACnet/IP, BACnet/SC or MS/TP transport, from Rust or Python. Use the
  standalone server when you need its full service set.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only use this on networks and devices you are authorized to access.
> Discovery generates network traffic. Writes, device management, time
> synchronization and file transfers can change real equipment. Start with the
> loopback examples below. Rusty BACnet makes no physical-safety guarantee.

## Install

CI runs the test suites on Linux, and natively on macOS (Apple Silicon) and
Windows (x86_64).

### Python

```bash
python -m pip install rusty-bacnet
```

This needs Python 3.11 or newer. The import name is `rusty_bacnet`. Wheels are
published for CPython 3.11–3.14 on Linux (glibc 2.17 or newer; x86_64,
aarch64), macOS (x86_64 on 10.12 or later, arm64 on 11.0 or later) and Windows
(x64). Every wheel includes BACnet/IPv6, BACnet/SC and MS/TP. On any other
Python version, platform or musl-based Linux, pip builds from source, which
needs Rust 1.93 or newer and a C compiler. Add `--only-binary=:all:` to fail
fast instead.

### Rust

Add only the crates you need. Most applications start with the client or the
server crate:

```toml
[dependencies]
bacnet-client = "0.12"
bacnet-types = "0.12"
bacnet-encoding = "0.12"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["macros", "rt-multi-thread"] }
```

The minimum supported Rust version is **1.93**.

### CLI

Download the `bacnet-<os>-<arch>` file for your platform from the
[latest release](https://github.com/jscott3201/rusty-bacnet/releases/latest),
check it against the release's `SHA256SUMS`, rename it to `bacnet`
(`bacnet.exe` on Windows), make it executable and put it on your `PATH`. The
[installation guide](https://jscott3201.github.io/rusty-bacnet/start/installation/)
has the checksum command for each OS.
- There are builds for Linux (amd64, arm64), macOS (amd64, arm64) and Windows
  (amd64), all with BACnet/SC. The Linux builds also include packet capture.
- The Linux builds need glibc 2.17 or newer (RHEL/CentOS 7, Debian 8, Ubuntu
  14.04 and later) and no libpcap package, because they link it statically.
- The macOS builds need macOS 10.12 (amd64) or 11.0 (arm64) or later. They
  aren't notarized, so macOS may block one downloaded through a browser.
- The Windows build links the C runtime statically, so it needs no Visual C++
  Redistributable.

`bacnet-cli` is also on crates.io, so Cargo can build it on any platform with
Rust 1.93 or later. Add `,pcap` to the features for capture, which needs the
libpcap headers:

```bash
cargo install bacnet-cli --locked --features sc-tls
# or, from a checkout:
cargo install --path crates/bacnet-cli --locked --features sc-tls
```

### Build from source

To try changes merged after the release, build from a `dev` checkout. Its
version may still read 0.12.0, so record the commit you built.

- **Python:** in a virtual environment, run `python -m pip install "maturin>=1,<2"`,
  then `maturin develop --release --manifest-path crates/rusty-bacnet/Cargo.toml --locked`.
- **Rust:** depend on the git branch, for example
  `bacnet-client = { git = "https://github.com/jscott3201/rusty-bacnet", branch = "dev" }`.

## Quickstart

These examples run entirely on loopback. Start the server in one terminal and
leave it running. Then read from it in a second terminal with Python, Rust or
the CLI.

### 1. Run a local server (Python)

Save this as `local_server.py` and run `python local_server.py`. It serves one
simulated temperature sensor on `127.0.0.1:47808`. Stop it with **Ctrl+C**.

```python
import asyncio
from rusty_bacnet import BACnetServer


async def main():
    server = BACnetServer(
        device_instance=1234,
        device_name="Local BACnet lab",
        interface="127.0.0.1",
        port=47808,
        broadcast_address="127.0.0.1",
    )
    # Units 62 = degrees Celsius. Add objects before starting the server.
    server.add_analog_input(1, "Zone temperature", units=62, present_value=22.5)
    try:
        await server.start()
        print(f"Listening at {await server.local_address()}", flush=True)
        await asyncio.Event().wait()
    finally:
        await server.stop()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        asyncio.run(main())
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
```

Before you leave loopback, pick a device instance that is unique on your
network.

### 2. Read a property

**Python:**

```python
import asyncio
from rusty_bacnet import BACnetClient, ObjectIdentifier, ObjectType, PropertyIdentifier


async def main():
    # Port 0 picks a free local port, so it doesn't clash with the server.
    async with BACnetClient(
        interface="127.0.0.1", port=0, broadcast_address="127.0.0.1"
    ) as client:
        value = await client.read_property(
            "127.0.0.1:47808",
            ObjectIdentifier(ObjectType.ANALOG_INPUT, 1),
            PropertyIdentifier.PRESENT_VALUE,
        )
        print(value.value)  # 22.5


asyncio.run(main())
```

**Rust:** create a project with `cargo new`, add the dependencies from
[Install](#rust), replace `src/main.rs` with the following, then `cargo run`:

```rust
use bacnet_client::client::BACnetClient;
use bacnet_encoding::primitives::decode_application_value;
use bacnet_types::enums::{ObjectType, PropertyIdentifier};
use bacnet_types::primitives::ObjectIdentifier;
use std::net::Ipv4Addr;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let oid = ObjectIdentifier::new(ObjectType::ANALOG_INPUT, 1)?;
    let mut client = BACnetClient::bip_builder()
        .interface(Ipv4Addr::LOCALHOST)
        .port(0)
        .broadcast_address(Ipv4Addr::LOCALHOST)
        .build()
        .await?;

    // A BACnet/IP address: four IPv4 octets, then the UDP port (0xBAC0 = 47808).
    let address = [127, 0, 0, 1, 0xBA, 0xC0];
    let response = client
        .read_property(&address, oid, PropertyIdentifier::PRESENT_VALUE, None)
        .await;
    client.stop().await?;

    let ack = response?;
    let (value, _) = decode_application_value(&ack.property_value, 0)?;
    println!("{value:?}");
    Ok(())
}
```

**CLI:**

```bash
bacnet --interface 127.0.0.1 --port 0 read 127.0.0.1:47808 ai:1 pv
bacnet --interface 127.0.0.1 --port 0 --json readm 127.0.0.1:47808 ai:1 pv,object-name
```

`ai:1` is Analog Input 1 and `pv` is Present_Value. Next, try discovery, COV
subscriptions and multi-property reads in the
[Python guide](https://jscott3201.github.io/rusty-bacnet/start/python/),
[Rust guide](https://jscott3201.github.io/rusty-bacnet/start/rust/) or
[CLI reference](docs/CLI.md). The [`examples/`](examples/) directory has
complete Rust, Python and Docker setups.

## Transports

BACnet/IP is always available. The other transports are opt-in Cargo features
of `bacnet-transport`:
- `bacnet-client` also has `ipv6` and `sc-tls` features.
- `bacnet-server` and `bacnet-endpoint` have `sc-tls`.

These turn on each crate's builders for those transports. The Python package
includes BACnet/IPv6, BACnet/SC and MS/TP, but not Ethernet.

| Transport | Feature | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| BACnet/IP (UDP/IPv4) | none | Includes BBMD and foreign-device registration. NAT traversal and B/IP multicast are not implemented. |
| BACnet/IPv6 | `ipv6` | Binds one concrete interface and address. With `::`, startup fails if the host has more than one candidate, so pass a concrete address. |
| BACnet/SC | `sc-tls` | Nodes, direct connections and a hub over TLS 1.3. Requires a site CA, a certificate and key for each device, and a provisioned device UUID. |
| MS/TP | `serial` (`serial-gpio` for GPIO direction control) | Standard frames only (no extended or COBS frames). RS-485 kernel options and GPIO are Linux-only. Evidence comes from a simulator and loopback; on-wire timing isn't qualified on any adapter or OS. |
| Ethernet (802.3 LLC) | `ethernet` | Linux only (`AF_PACKET`). Needs `CAP_NET_RAW` or root. |

The [BACnet/SC guide](https://jscott3201.github.io/rusty-bacnet/guides/bacnet-sc/)
covers CLI trust and identity. Before 0.12.0, BACnet/IPv6 could fall back to a
wildcard address and the CLI loaded SC trust from the system roots; the
[upgrade guide](https://jscott3201.github.io/rusty-bacnet/project/upgrading/)
lists what to change.

How to configure each one:
- [Transport configuration](docs/rust-api.md#transport-configuration-examples) (Rust)
- [Python transport examples](docs/python-api.md#transport-configuration-examples)
- [MS/TP guide](https://jscott3201.github.io/rusty-bacnet/guides/mstp/)

## Conformance

Rusty BACnet is **not BTL certified** and does not claim full BACnet
conformance. The website's
[What's supported](https://jscott3201.github.io/rusty-bacnet/project/support/#whats-supported)
section lists the object types, services, transports and Python bindings that
0.12.0 implements. A running server can also generate a PICS for its
own objects and services with `bacnet_server::pics`.

## Contributing

Bug reports, test cases, documentation fixes and focused patches are welcome.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the pull request flow, and the
[documentation guide](https://jscott3201.github.io/rusty-bacnet/project/contributing/)
for docs changes.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jscott3201/rusty-bacnet.git
cd rusty-bacnet
cargo install cargo-nextest --locked   # 0.9.145 or newer
cargo build --locked
cargo nextest run --workspace --exclude rusty-bacnet --locked
cargo test --doc --workspace --exclude rusty-bacnet --locked
```

nextest skips doctests, which is why `cargo test --doc` is a separate step. The
repository pins Rust 1.99.0 in `rust-toolchain.toml`. For Python binding
development (on Windows, activate with `.venv\Scripts\activate`; the BACnet/SC
tests also need the `openssl` command):

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install "maturin>=1,<2"
maturin develop --manifest-path crates/rusty-bacnet/Cargo.toml --locked
python -m unittest discover -s crates/rusty-bacnet/tests
```

[`docs/ci.md`](docs/ci.md) lists the full set of checks CI runs, including
clippy, rustdoc and the feature matrix.

When you [open an issue](https://github.com/jscott3201/rusty-bacnet/issues),
include:
- the version or commit;
- your OS and the transport you use;
- a minimal reproduction that leaves out credentials and captures from real
  networks.
