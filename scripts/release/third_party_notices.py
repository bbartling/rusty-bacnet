"""Write THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES for the release binaries (#943, #944).

    third_party_notices.py --out THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES [--libpcap /opt/libpcap]

Lists what the release binaries link statically, with where to get each
component's source and every licence file it ships:
- the Rust crates in the bacnet CLI and in the rusty_bacnet Python extension,
  for every release target (TARGETS, with the CLI's features on each):
  `cargo tree` with normal edges only, so build scripts, proc-macros and
  dev-dependencies, which end up in no binary, are left out, and so are the
  crates of targets that aren't released. A crate's source is its crates.io
  page for that version (or, for a crate from elsewhere, its repository);
- libpcap, which the CLI links statically (--libpcap: a directory with its
  LICENSE and VERSION, which the CI image installs under /opt/libpcap).

Identical licence texts are printed once, followed by every crate that ships
them. Generation fails if a crate under a licence that needs its notice kept
(anything but the ones in NO_NOTICE, whose terms don't ask for it in a
binary) ships no licence file,
unless ALLOW_NO_LICENSE_FILE names it with a reason. The output depends only
on Cargo.lock, the crate sources and libpcap, so a rebuild produces the same
file. Run `cargo fetch --locked` first: cargo runs with --offline here.
